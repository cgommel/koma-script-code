\chapter{The Main Classes \Class{scrbook}, \Class{scrrprt} and
  \Class{scrartcl}}

\AddSeeIndex{command}{gen}{\GuidecmdIndexShort}{cmd}
\AddSeeIndex{macro}{gen}{\GuidecmdIndexShort}{cmd}%

\begin{Explain}
  The main classes of the {\KOMAScript} bundle are designed as
  counterparts to the standard {\LaTeX} classes. This means that the
  {\KOMAScript} bundle contains replacements for the three standard
  classes \Class{book}\IndexClass{book},
  \Class{report}\IndexClass{report} and
  \Class{article}\IndexClass{article}. There is also a replacement for
  the standard class \Class{letter}\IndexClass{letter}. The
  document class for letters is described in a separate chapter,
  because it is fundamentally different from the three main classes
  (see \autoref{cha:scrlttr2}).The names of the {\KOMAScript}
  classes are composed of the prefix "\texttt{scr}" and the
  abbreviated name of the corresponding standard class. In order to
  restrict the length of the names to eight letters, the vowels,
  starting with the last one, are left off if necessary. The
  \autoref{tab:maincls.overview} shows an overview. The table also
  includes the names of the \LaTeX2.09 style files that were used in
  {\KOMAScript}.
\end{Explain}

The simplest way to use a \KOMAScript-class instead of a standard one
is to substitute the class name in the \verb|\documentclass| command
according to \autoref{tab:maincls.overview}. Normally the document
should be processed without errors by \LaTeX{}, just like before the
substitution. The look however should be different. Additionally, the
\KOMAScript{} classes provide new possibilities and options that are
described in the following sections.

    standard classes, \KOMAScript{} classes and

\section{The Options}
\label{sec:maincls.options}


This section describes the global options of the three main classes.
The majority of the options can also be found in the standard classes.
Since experience shows that many options of the standard classes are
unknown, their description is included here. This is a departure from
the rule that the \File{scrguide} should only describe those aspects
whose implementation differs from the standard one.

Table~\ref{tab:maincls.stdOptions} lists those options that are set by
default in at least one of the {\KOMAScript} classes. The table shows
for each {\KOMAScript} main class if the option is set by default and
if it is even defined for that class. An undefined option cannot be
set, either by default or by the user.

\begin{table}[htbp]
  \centering
  \caption{Default options of the \KOMAScript{} classes}
  \begin{tabular}{llll}

    \hline\rule{0pt}{2.7ex}%
    \Option{11pt}          &

                     & default & default \\
    \Option{openright}     &
      default &                &                \\
    \Option{parindent}     &
      default & default & default \\
    \Option{tablecaptionbelow} &
      default & default & default \\
    \Option{titlepage}     &
      default & default                  \\
    \Option{tocindent} &
      default & default & default \\
    \Option{twoside}       &
      default &                &                \\
  \end{tabular}
  \label{tab:maincls.stdOptions}
\end{table}

\begin{Explain}
  Allow me an observation before proceeding with the descriptions of
  the options. It is often the case that at the beginning of a
  document one is often unsure which options to choose for that
  specific document. Some options, for instance the choice of paper
  size, may be fixed from the beginning. But already the question of
  which \Var{DIV} value to use could be difficult to answer initially.
  On the other hand, this kind of information should be initially
  irrelevant for the main tasks of an author: design of the document
  structure, text writing, preparation of figures, tables and index.
  As an author you should concentrate initially on the contents. When
  that is done, you can concentrate on the fine points of
  presentation. Besides the choice of options, this means correcting
  things like hyphenation, page breaks, and the distribution of tables
  and figures. As an example consider the
  \autoref{tab:maincls.stdOptions} that I have moved repeatedly
  between the beginning and the end of this section. The choice of the
  actual position will only be made during the final production of the
  document.

\subsection{Options for Page Layout}
\label{sec:maincls.typeareaOptions}

With the standard classes the page layout\Index{page layout} is established by
the option files \File{size10.clo}, \File{size11.clo}, \File{size12.clo} (or
\File{bk10.clo}, \File{bk11.clo}, \File{bk12.clo} for the book class) and by
fixed values in the class definitions. The \KOMAScript{} classes, however, do
not use a fixed page layout, but one that depends on the paper
format\Index{paper format} and font size. For this task all three main classes
use the \Package{typearea} package\IndexPackage{typearea} (see
\autoref{cha:typearea}).  The package is automatically loaded by the
\KOMAScript{} main classes.  Therefore it is not necessary to use the command
\Macro{usepackage}\OParameter{package options}\PParameter{typearea}
explicitly.


\begin{Declaration}
  \Option{letterpaper} \\
  \Option{legalpaper} \\
  \Option{executivepaper} \\
  \Option{a\Var{X}paper} \\
  \Option{b\Var{X}paper} \\
  \Option{c\Var{X}paper} \\
  \Option{d\Var{X}paper} \\
  \Option{landscape}
\end{Declaration}%
\BeginIndex{Option}{letterpaper}%
\BeginIndex{Option}{legalpaper}%
\BeginIndex{Option}{executivepaper}%
\BeginIndex{Option}{a0paper}%
\BeginIndex{Option}{b0paper}%
\BeginIndex{Option}{c0paper}%
\BeginIndex{Option}{d0paper}%
\BeginIndex{Option}{landscape}%
The basic options for the choice of paper format are not processed directly by
the classes. They are automatically processed by the \Package{typearea}
package as global options (see \autoref{sec:typearea.options},
\autopageref{desc:typearea.option.letterpaper}). The options \Option{a5paper},
\Option{a4paper}, \Option{letterpaper}, \Option{legalpaper} and
\Option{executivepaper} correspond to the options of the standard classes that
have the same name and define the same paper format.  The page layout
calculated for each is different, however.
%
\EndIndex{Option}{letterpaper}%
\EndIndex{Option}{legalpaper}%
\EndIndex{Option}{executivepaper}%
\EndIndex{Option}{a0paper}%
\EndIndex{Option}{b0paper}%
\EndIndex{Option}{c0paper}%
\EndIndex{Option}{d0paper}%
\EndIndex{Option}{landscape}

\begin{Explain}
  The options for the A, B, C or D format are actually not processed
  by the \Package{typearea}, because they are global options, but
  because the \KOMAScript{} classes explicitly pass them to the
  \Package{typearea} package. This is caused by the way option
  processing is implemented in the \Package{typearea} package and by
  the operation of the underlying option passing and processing
  mechanism of \LaTeX.

  This is also valid for the options, described subsequently, that set
  the binding correcting, the divisor and the number of header lines.
\end{Explain}


\begin{Declaration}
  \Option{BCOR}\PName{correction}\\
  \Option{DIV}\PName{factor}\\
  \Option{DIVcalc}\\
  \Option{DIVclassic}\\
  \PName{Value}\Option{headlines}
\end{Declaration}%
\BeginIndex{Option}{BCOR}%
\BeginIndex{Option}{DIV}%
\BeginIndex{Option}{DIVcalc}%
\BeginIndex{Option}{DIVclassic}%
\BeginIndex{Option}{headlines}%
The options for the divisor and the binding correction\Index{binding
  correction} are passed directly to the \Package{typearea} package
(see \autoref{sec:typearea.options}, \autopageref{desc:typearea.option.BCOR}
till \autopageref{desc:typearea.option.headlines}). This differs from the
standard classes, where there is no such transfer. This is also valid
for the option that sets the number of header lines.

\subsection{Options for Document Layout}
\label{sec:maincls.layoutOptions}

This subsection collects all the options that affect the document
layout, not only the page layout. Strictly speaking all page layout
options (see \autoref{sec:maincls.typeareaOptions}) are also
document layout options. The reverse is also partially true.

\begin{Declaration}
  \Option{oneside}\\
  \Option{twoside}
\end{Declaration}%
\BeginIndex{Option}{oneside}
\BeginIndex{Option}{twoside}%
These two options have the same effect as with the standard classes.
The option \Option{oneside} defines a one-sided document layout with a
one-sided page layout. This means in particular that normally a ragged
page bottom is used.

The option \Option{twoside} defines a two-sided document layout with a
two-sided page layout. This means that the \LaTeX{} command
\Macro{flushbottom}\IndexCmd{flushbottom} is used to ensure that page
breaks don't leave a variable empty space at the bottom of the page. A
ragged page bottom can be obtained with the \LaTeX{} command
\Macro{raggedbottom}\IndexCmd{raggedbottom}.
%
\EndIndex{Option}{oneside}%
\EndIndex{Option}{twoside}%


\begin{Declaration}
  \Option{onecolumn}\\
  \Option{twocolumn}
\end{Declaration}%
\BeginIndex{Option}{onecolumn}
\BeginIndex{Option}{twocolumn}%
These options have the same effect as the corresponding standard
options. They are used to switch between a one-column and a two-column
layout. The standard \LaTeX{} capabilities for multi-column layout are
only useful for very simple uses. The standard package
\Package{multicol} is much more versatile (see
\cite{package:multicol}).\Index{columns}\IndexPackage{multicol}
%
\EndIndex{Option}{onecolumn} \EndIndex{Option}{twocolumn}


\begin{Declaration}
  \Option{openany}\\
  \Option{openright}
\end{Declaration}%
\BeginIndex{Option}{openany}%
\BeginIndex{Option}{openright}%
These\OnlyAt{\Class{scrbook}\and\Class{scrreprt}} options have the
same effect as the corresponding standard options. They affect the
choice of the page where a chapter\Index[indexmain]{chapter} can begin,
so they are not available with the \Class{scrartcl} class, since there
the main unit below ``part'' is the ``section''. The chapter level is
not available in \Class{scrartcl}.

A chapter always begins with a new page. When the option
\Option{openany} is active, any page can be used. The option
\Option{openright} causes the chapter to begin with a new right page.
An empty left page may be inserted automatically in this case. The
empty pages are created by the implicit execution of the \LaTeX{}
command \Macro{cleardoublepage}\IndexCmd{cleardoublepage}.

The option \Option{openright} has no effect with a one-sided layout,
because only the two-sided layout differentiates between left and
right pages. For this reason it should only be used together with the
\Option{twoside} option.
%
\EndIndex{Option}{openany}%
\EndIndex{Option}{openright}


\begin{Declaration}
  \Option{cleardoublestandard}\\
  \Option{cleardoubleplain}\\
  \Option{cleardoubleempty}
\end{Declaration}%
\BeginIndex{Option}{cleardoublestandard}%
\BeginIndex{Option}{cleardoubleplain}%
\BeginIndex{Option}{cleardoubleempty}%
If one wishes the empty pages created by the \Macro{cleardoublepage}
command to have no headers or footers while using the standard
classes, the only possibility is to redefine the command
appropriately. {\KOMAScript} provides options that avoid this. The
option \Option{cleardoublestandard} enables the default
\Macro{cleardoublepage} behaviour. If the option
\Option{cleardoubleplain} is used, then the
\PValue{plain}\IndexPagestyle{plain} page style is applied to the
empty left page. The option \Option{cleardoubleempty} causes the
\PValue{empty}\IndexPagestyle{empty} page style to be used. The page
styles are described in \autoref{sec:maincls.pageStyle}.
%
\EndIndex{Option}{cleardoublestandard}%
\EndIndex{Option}{cleardoubleplain}%
\EndIndex{Option}{cleardoubleempty}%


\begin{Declaration}
  \Option{titlepage}\\
  \Option{notitlepage}
\end{Declaration}%
\BeginIndex{Option}{titlepage}%
\BeginIndex{Option}{notitlepage}%
Both options have the same effect as the corresponding standard ones.
The \Option{titlepage} option makes {\LaTeX} use separate pages for
the titles.  These pages are set inside a \Environment{titlepage}
environment and normally have neither header nor footer. In comparison
with standard \LaTeX, \KOMAScript{} expands the handling of the titles
significantly (see \autoref{sec:maincls.titles}).

The option \Option{notitlepage} specifies that an \emph{in-page} title
is used. This means that the title is specially emphasized, but it may
be followed by more material on the same page, for instance by an
abstract or a section.

\BeginIndex{Option}{parindent}%
  The standard classes normally set
  paragraphs\Index[indexmain]{paragraph} indented and without any
  vertical inter-paragraph space.  This is the best solution when
  using a regular page layout, like the ones produced with the
  \Package{typearea} package. If there where no indentation and no
  vertical space, only the length of last line would give the reader a
  reference point. In extreme cases, it is very difficult to detect if
  a line is full or not. Furthermore, it is found that a marker at the
  paragraph's end tends to be easily forgotten. A marker at the
  paragraph's beginning is easily remembered.  Inter-paragraph spacing
  has the drawback of disappearing in some contexts. For instance,
  after a displayed formula it would be impossible to detect if the
  previous paragraph continues or if a new one begins. Also, when
  starting to read at a new page it might be necessary to look at the
  previous page in order determine if a new paragraph has been started
  or not. All these problems disappear when using indentation. A
  combination of indentation and vertical inter-paragraph spacing is
  redundant and should be rejected. The
  indentation\Index[indexmain]{indentation} is perfectly sufficient by
  itself. The only drawback of indentation is the reduction of the
  line length. The use of inter-paragraph spacing is therefore
  justified when using short lines, for instance in a newspaper.
\end{Explain}


Independently of the explanation above, there are often requests for a
document layout with vertical inter-paragraph spacing instead of
indentation.  \KOMAScript{} provides a large number of related
options: \Option{parskip}, \Option{parskip-}, \Option{parskip*},
\Option{parskip+} and \Option{halfparskip}, \Option{halfparskip-},
\Option{halfparskip*} and \Option{halfparskip+}.

The four \Option{parskip} options define an inter-paragraph spacing of
one line. The four \Option{halfparskip} options use just a spacing of
half a line.  In order to avoid a change of paragraph going unnoticed,
for instance after a page break, three of the options of each set
ensure that the last line of a paragraph is not full. The variants
without plus or star sign ensure a free space of 1\Unit{em}. The plus
variant ensures that at least a third of the line is free and the star
variant ensures that at least a fourth of the line is free. The minus
variants make no special provision for the last line of a paragraph.

All eight options change the spacing before, after and inside list
environments. This avoids the problem of having these environments or
the paragraphs inside them with a larger separation than the
separation between the paragraphs of normal text. Additionally, these
options ensure that the table of contents and the lists of figures and
tables are set without any additional spacing.

The default behaviour of \KOMAScript{} follows the \Option{parindent}
option.  In this case, there is no spacing between paragraphs, only an
indentation of the first line by 1\Unit{em}.

\BeginIndex{Option}{footnosepline}%
In order to have a line separating the header from the text body use
the option \Option{headsepline}. The option \Option{headnosepline} has
the reverse effect. These options have no effect with the page styles
\PValue{empty} and \PValue{plain}, because there is no header in this
case. Such a line always has the effect of visually approximating
header and text body. That doesn't mean that the header must be put
farther apart from the text body. Instead, the header should be
considered to belong to the text body for the purpose of page layout
calculations. {\KOMAScript} takes this into account by automatically
passing the option \Option{headinclude} to the \Package{typearea}
package whenever the \Option{headsepline} option is used.

The presence of a line between text body and footer is controlled by
the options \Option{footsepline} and \Option{footnosepline}, that
behave like the corresponding header functions. Whenever a line is
requested by the \Option{footsepline} option, the \Option{footinclude}
option is automatically passed to the \Package{typearea} package. In
contrast to \Option{headsepline}, \Option{footsepline} takes effect
when used together with the page style \PValue{plain}, because the
\PValue{plain} style produces a page number in the footer.

  "Chapter" is naturally translated to the appropriate language.}%
followed by the chapter number. The title itself is set left-justified
on the following lines. The same effect is obtained in \KOMAScript{}
with the class option \Option{chapterprefix}. The default however is
\Option{nochapterprefix}. These options also affect the automatic
running titles in the headers (see

an appendix\Index{appendix} to be preceded by a line with "Appendix"
followed by the appendix letter. This is achieved by using the
\Option{appendixprefix} option. Since this results in an inconsistent
document layout, I advise against using this option.

The reverse option \Option{noappendixprefix} exists only for
completeness' sake. I don't know of any sensible use for it.

\end{Declaration}
\BeginIndex{Option}{onelinecaption}%
The standard classes differentiate between one-line and multi-line
table or figure captions. One-line captions are centered while
multi-line captions are left-justified. This behavior, which is also
the default with \KOMAScript, corresponds to the option
\Option{onelinecaption}. There is no special handling of one-line
captions when the \Option{noonelinecaption} option is given.

\begin{Explain}
  The avoidance of a special treatment for the caption has an
  additional effect that is sometimes greatly desired. Footnotes
  that appear inside a \Macro{caption} command often have a wrong
  number assigned to them. This happens because the footnote counter
  is incremented once when the line is measured. When the
  \Option{noonelinecaption} option is used no such measurement is
  made. The footnote numbers are therefore correct.

  But since \KOMAScript{} version 2.9 you don't need the option
  \Option{noonelinecaption} to avoid the above described
  effect. \KOMAScript{} classes contain a workaround, so if you have
  footnotes at captions you simply should put the contents of the
  figure or table into a minipage and everything will be nice.

\subsection{Options for Font Selection}
\label{sec:maincls.fontOptions}

Font options are those options that affect the font size of the
document or the fonts of individual elements. Options that affect the
font style are also theoretically font options. However {\KOMAScript}
currently has no such options.

\begin{Declaration}
  \Option{10pt}\\%
  \Option{11pt}\\%
  \Option{12pt}\\

\BeginIndex{Option}{10pt}%
\BeginIndex{Option}{11pt}%
\BeginIndex{Option}{12pt}%
\BeginIndex{Option}{\Var{X}pt}%
The options \Option{10pt}, \Option{11pt} and \Option{12pt} have the
same effect as the corresponding standard options. In contrast to the
standard classes, {\KOMAScript} can be used to choose other font
sizes\Index[indexmain]{font size}. However {\LaTeX} provides the
necessary class option files only for 10\Unit{pt}, 11\Unit{pt} und
12\Unit{pt}, so that the user must provide any other class option
files. The package \Package{extsizes} (see
\cite{package:extsizes})\IndexPackage{extsizes} can be used for that
task. Very big font sizes may lead to arithmetic overflow inside the
page layout calculations of the \Package{typearea} package.

\BeginIndex{Option}{bigheadings}%
The font size used for the titles\index{title}\index{document structure} is
relatively big, both with the standard classes and with {\KOMAScript}. Not
everyone likes this choice; moreover it is specially problematic for small
paper sizes. Consequently {\KOMAScript} provides, besides the large title font
size defined by the \Option{bigheadings} option, the two options
\Option{normalheadings} and \Option{smallheadings}, that allow for smaller
title font sizes. The resulting font sizes for headings at \Class{scrbook} and
\Class{scrreprt} shows\autoref{tab:maincls.structureElementsFont},
\autopageref{tab:maincls.structureElementsFont}. At \Class{scrartcl} smaller
font sizes are used.

\OnlyAt{\Class{scrbook}\and\Class{scrreprt}}The spacing before and
after chapter titles is also influenced by these options. Chapter
titles are also influenced by the options \Option{chapterprefix} and
\Option{nochapterprefix}, and appendix titles by the options
\Option{appendixprefix} and \Option{noappendixprefix}, all of them
are described in \autoref{sec:maincls.layoutOptions},
\autopageref{desc:maincls.option.chapterprefix}.

\subsection{Options Affecting the Table of Contents}
\label{sec:maincls.tocOptions}

{\KOMAScript} has several options that affect the entries in the table
of contents\Index[indexmain]{table of contents}. The form of the table
of contents is fixed but several variations of the contents can be
obtained with the options provided.

\begin{Explain}%
\begin{Declaration}
  \Option{liststotoc}\\
  \Option{idxtotoc}\\
  \Option{bibtotoc}\\
  \Option{bibtotocnumbered}\\
  \Option{liststotocnumbered}
\end{Declaration}%
\BeginIndex{Option}{liststotoc}%
\BeginIndex{Option}{idxtotoc}%
\BeginIndex{Option}{bibtotoc}%
\BeginIndex{Option}{bibtotocnumbered}%
\BeginIndex{Option}{liststotocnumbered}%
  Lists of tables and figures, index and bibliography are not normally
  included in the table of contents. These entries are omitted in
  classical typography because it is silently assumed that, if at all,
  lists of figures and tables come after the table of contents, the
  index comes at the end and the bibliography comes before the index.
  Books with all these parts often include ribbons that can be used to
  mark the location of these parts in the book, so that the reader
  only has to look for them once.
\end{Explain}

It is becoming increasingly common to find entries in the table of
contents for the lists of tables and figures, for the bibliography,
and, sometimes, even for the index. This is certainly related to the
recent trend of putting lists of figures and tables at the end of the
document. Both lists are similiar to the table of contents in
structure and intention. I'm therefore sceptical of this evolution.
Since it makes no sense to include only one of the aforementioned lists
in the table of contents, there exists only one option
\Option{liststotoc} that causes entries for both types of lists to be
included. This also includes any lists produced with version 1.2e or
later of the \Package{float}\IndexPackage{float} package (see
\cite{package:float}).  All these lists are unnumbered, since they
contain entries that reference other sections of the document.

The option \Option{idxtotoc} causes an entry for the index to be
included in the table of contents. The index is also unnumbered since
it only includes references to the contents of the other sectional
units.

The bibliography is a different kind of listing. It does not list the
contents of the present document but refers instead to external
documents. On these reasons it could be argued that it is a different
chapter (or section) and, as such, should be numbered. The option
\Option{bibtotocnumbered} has this effect, including the generation of
the corresponding entry in the table of contents. I think that a
similar reasoning would lead us to consider a classical list of
sources to be a separate chapter. Also, the bibliography is not
something that was written by the document's author. In view of this,
the bibliography merits nothing more than an unnumbered entry in the
table of contents, and that can be achieved with the \Option{bibtotoc}
option.

The author of \KOMAScript{} doesn't like option
\Option{bibtotocnumbered}. He almost detests option
\Option{liststotocnumbered}. Because of this you won't find a detailed
description of this option. Nevertheless it exists.

\begin{Declaration}
  \Option{tocindent}\\
  \Option{tocleft}
\end{Declaration}%
\BeginIndex{Option}{tocindent}%
\BeginIndex{Option}{tocleft}%
The table of contents is normally\ChangedAt{v2.8q}{%
  \Class{scrbook}\and\Class{scrreprt}\and\Class{scrartcl}} setup so
that different sectional units have different indentations. The
section number is set left-justified in a fixed-width field. This
setup is selected with the option \Option{tocindent}.

When there are many sections, the corresponding numbering tends to
become very wide, so that the reserved field overflows. The FAQ
\cite{DANTE:FAQ} suggests that the table of contents should be redefined
in such a case. \KOMAScript{} offers an alternative format that avoids
the problem completely. If the option \Option{tocleft} is selected,
then no variable indentation is applied to the titles of the sectional
units. Instead, a table-like organisation is used, where all unit
numbers and titles, respectively, are set in a left-justified column.
The space necessary for the unit numbers is determined automatically.

\begin{Explain}
  In order to calculate automatically the space taken by the unit
  numbers when using the option \Option{tocleft} it is necessary to
  redefine some macros. It is improbable but not impossible that this
  leads to problems when using other packages. If you think this may
  be causing problems, you should try the alternative option
  \Option{tocindent}, since it does not make any redefinitions. When
  using packages that affect the format of the table of contents, it
  is possible that the use of options \Option{tocleft} and
  \Option{tocindent} may lead to problems. In that case, one should
  use neither of these global (class) option.

  If the \Option{tocleft} option is active, the width of the field for
  unit numbering is determined when outputting the table of contents.
  After a change that affects the table of contents, at most three
  \LaTeX{} runs are necessary to obtain a correctly set table of
  contents.
\end{Explain}

\subsection{Options for Lists of Floats}
\label{sec:maincls.listsOptions}

The best known lists of floats are the list of figures and the list of tables.
With help from the \Package{float}\IndexPackage{float} package, for instance,
it is possible to produce new float environments with the corresponding lists.

\begin{Explain}
  Whether \KOMAScript{} options have any effect on lists of floats
  produced by other packages depends mainly on those packages. This is
  generally the case with the lists of floats produced by the
  \Package{float}\IndexPackage{float} package.

  Besides the options described here, there are others that affect the
  lists of floats though not their formatting or contents. Instead
  they affect what is included in the table of contents. The
  corresponding descriptions can therefore be found in
  \autoref{sec:maincls.tocOptions}.
\end{Explain}

\begin{Declaration}
  \Option{listsindent}\\
  \Option{listsleft}
\end{Declaration}%
\BeginIndex{Option}{listsindent}%
\BeginIndex{Option}{listsleft}%
Lists of figures and tables\ChangedAt{v2.8q}{%
  \Class{scrbook}\and\Class{scrreprt}\and\Class{scrartcl}} are
generally setup so that their numbering uses a fixed space. This
corresponds to the use of option \Option{listsindent}.

If the numbers get too large, for instance because many tables are used, it
may happen that the available space is exceeded. Therefore \KOMAScript{}
supplies an option called \Option{listsleft} that is similar to the
\Option{tocleft} option. The width of the numbers is automatically determined
and the space for them correspondingly adjusted. Concerning the mode of
operation and the side effects, the observations made in
\autoref{sec:maincls.tocOptions}, \autopageref{desc:maincls.option.tocleft}
for the \Option{tocleft} option are equally valid in this case. Please note
that when using the \Option{listsleft} option several \LaTeX{} runs are
necessary before the lists of floats achieve their final form.
%

\EndIndex{Option}{listsleft}%



\subsection{Options Affecting the Formatting}
\label{sec:maincls.formattingOptions}

Formatting options are all those options that affect the form or
formatting of the document and are not assigned to other sections.
They are the \emph{remaining options}.

\begin{Declaration}
  \Option{abstracton}\\
  \Option{abstractoff}
\end{Declaration}%
\BeginIndex{Option}{abstracton}%
\BeginIndex{Option}{abstractoff}%
In\OnlyAt{\Class{scrreprt}\and\Class{scrartcl}} the standard classes
the \Environment{abstract} environment sets the text "\abstractname"
centered before the summary text\Index[indexmain]{summary}. This was the
normal procedure in the past. In the meantime, newspaper reading has
trained the readers to recognize a displayed text at the beginning of
an article or report as the abstract. This is even more so when the
abstract comes before the table of contents. It is also surprising
that precisely this title appears small and centered. {\KOMAScript}
provides the possibility of including or excluding the abstract's
title with the options \Option{abstracton} and \Option{abstractoff}.

\begin{Explain}
  Books typically use another type of summary. In that case there is
  usually a dedicated summary chapter at the beginning or end of the
  book. This chapter is often combined with the introduction or with a
  description of further aspects. Therefore, the class \Class{scrbook}
  has no \Environment{abstract} environment. A summary chapter is also
  recommended for reports in a wider sense, like a Master's or Ph.D.
  thesis.
\end{Explain}
%
\EndIndex{Option}{abstracton}%
\EndIndex{Option}{abstractoff}%


\begin{Declaration}
  \Option{pointednumbers}\\
  \Option{pointlessnumbers}
\end{Declaration}%
\BeginIndex{Option}{pointednumbers}%
\BeginIndex{Option}{pointlessnumbers}%
\begin{Explain}%
  According to {\small DUDEN}, the numbering of sectional units should
  have no point at the end if only arabic numbers are used (see
  \cite[R\,3]{DUDEN}). On the other hand, if roman numerals or letters
  are used, then a point should appear at the end of the numbering (see
  \cite[R\,4]{DUDEN}). {\KOMAScript} has an internal mechanisms that
  tries to implement these rules. The resulting effect is that,
  normally, after the sectional commands \Macro{part} and
  \Macro{appendix} a switch is made to numbering with a point at the
  end. The information is saved in the \File{aux} file and takes
  effect on the next \LaTeX{} run.
\end{Explain}

In some cases the mechanism that switches the end point may fail or
other languagues may have different rules. Therefore it is possible to
activate the use of the end point with the option
\Option{pointednumbers} or to deactivate it with
\Option{pointlessnumbers}.

Please note that the mechanism only takes effect on the next \LaTeX{}
run.  When trying to use these options to control the numbering
format, a run without changing any options should be made.

Calling these options \Option{dottednumbers}\IndexOption{dottednumbers} and
\Option{dotlessnumbers}\IndexOption{dotlessnumbers} or similar would be more
correct. It so happened that the meaning of the chosen names was not clear to
me a few years ago when the options were implemented. Some people asked me not
to fix this ``funny little mistake'' so I didn't.
%
\EndIndex{Option}{pointednumbers}%
\EndIndex{Option}{pointlessnumbers}%

\begin{Declaration}
  \Option{leqno}
\end{Declaration}%
\BeginIndex{Option}{leqno}%
Equations\Index{equation} are normally numbered on the right.  The
standard option \Option{leqno} causes the standard option file
\File{leqno.clo} to be loaded. The equations are then numbered on the
left.
%
\EndIndex{Option}{leqno}%


\begin{Declaration}
  \Option{fleqn}
\end{Declaration}%
\BeginIndex{Option}{fleqn}%
Displayed equations are normally centered. The standard option
\Option{fleqn} causes the standard option file \File{fleqn.clo} to be
loaded. Displayed equations are then left-justified.
%
\EndIndex{Option}{fleqn}%

\begin{Declaration}
  \Option{tablecaptionbelow}\\
  \Option{tablecaptionabove}
\end{Declaration}%
\BeginIndex{Option}{tablecaptionbelow}%
\BeginIndex{Option}{tablecaptionabove}%
As described in \autoref{sec:maincls.floats},
\autopageref{desc:maincls.macro.caption}, the
\Macro{caption}\IndexCmd{caption} command acts with figures like the
\Macro{captionbelow}\IndexCmd{captionbelow} command. The behaviour with tables
depends on two options.  With the default \Option{tablecaptionbelow} options,
the \Macro{caption} macro acts like the \Macro{captionbelow} command. With the
\Option{tablecaptionabove} option, \Macro{caption} acts like the
\Macro{captionabove}\IndexCmd{captionabove} command.

Note that using any of these options does not changes the possition of the
caption from above the top of the table to the bottom of the table or vica
versa. It only changes the spacing between caption and e.g. tabular.

Note\OnlyAt{\Package{float}}\IndexPackage{float} that when using the
\Package{float} package, the options \Option{tablecaptionbelow} and
\Option{tablecaptionabove} cease to act correctly when the
\Macro{refloatstyle} is applied to tables. More details of the \Package{float}
package's \Macro{refloatstyle} can be obtained from
\cite{package:float}. Additional support for \Package{float} may be found at
\autoref{sec:maincls.floats}, \autopageref{desc:maincls.floatstyle.komaabove}.
%
\EndIndex{Option}{tablecaptionbelow}%
\EndIndex{Option}{tablecaptionabove}%


\begin{Explain}%
\begin{Declaration}
  \Option{origlongtable}
\end{Declaration}%
\BeginIndex{Option}{origlongtable}%
The package\OnlyAt{\Package{longtable}}
\Package{longtable}\IndexPackage{longtable} (see \cite{package:longtable})
sets table captions internally by calling the command \Macro{LT@makecaption}.
In order to ensure that these table captions match the ones used with normal
tables, the \KOMAScript{} classes normally redefine that command. See
\autoref{sec:maincls.floats},
\autopageref{desc:maincls.macro.caption.longtable} for more details. The
redefinition is performed with help of the command \Macro{AfterPackage}
immediately after the loading of package \Package{longtable}.  If the package
\Package{caption2}\IndexPackage{caption2} (see \cite{package:caption}) has
been previously loaded, the redefinition is not made in order not to interfere
with the \Package{caption2} package.
\end{Explain}
If the table captions produced by the \Package{longtable} package
should not be redefined by the \KOMAScript{}, activate the
\Option{origlongtable} option.
%
\EndIndex{Option}{origlongtable}%


\begin{Declaration}
  \Option{openbib}
\end{Declaration}%
\BeginIndex{Option}{openbib}%
The standard option \Option{openbib} switches to an alternative
bibliography format. The effects are twofold: The first line of a
bibliography entry, normally containing the author's name, gets a
smaller indentation; and the command \Macro{newblock} is redefined to
produce a paragraph. Without this option, \Macro{newblock} introduces
only a stretchable horizontal space.
%
\EndIndex{Option}{openbib}


\begin{Declaration}
  \Option{draft}\\
  \Option{final}
\end{Declaration}%
\BeginIndex{Option}{draft}%
\BeginIndex{Option}{final}%
The two standard options \Option{draft} and \Option{final} are
normally used to distinguish between the draft and final versions of a
document. The option \Option{draft} activates small black boxes that
are set at the end of overly long lines. The boxes help the untrained
eye to find paragraphs that have to be treated manually. With the
\Option{final} option no such boxes are shown.

The two options are also processed by other packages and affect their
workings. For instance, the \Package{graphics}\IndexPackage{graphics}
and the \Package{graphicx}\IndexPackage{graphicx} packages don't
actually output the graphics when the option \Option{draft} is
specified. Instead they output a framed box of the appropriate size
containing only the graphic's filename (see \cite{package:graphics}).
%
\EndIndex{Option}{draft}%
\EndIndex{Option}{final}%


\section{General Document Characteristics}
\label{sec:maincls.general}

Some document characteristics do not apply to a particular section of
the document like the titling, the text body or the bibliography, but
they affect the entire document. Some of these characteristics were
already described in \autoref{sec:maincls.options}.

\subsection{Changing Fonts}
\label{sec:maincls.font}

\BeginIndex{}{font}\BeginIndex{}{font size}%
\begin{Explain}
  \KOMAScript{} does not use fixed fonts and attributes to emphasize
  different elements of the text. Instead there are variables
  that contain the commands used for changing fonts and other text
  attributes. In previous versions of \KOMAScript{} the user had to
  use \Macro{renewcommand} to redefine those variables. It was also
  not easy to determine the name of the variable affecting an element
  given the element's name. It was also often necessary to determine
  the original definition before proceeding to redefine it.

  These difficulties were actually intended, since the interface was not
  for users, but only for package authors building their
  packages on top of \KOMAScript{}. The years have shown that the
  interface was mainly used by document authors. So a new, simpler
  interface was created. However, the author advises explicitly the
  typographically inexperienced user against changing font sizes and
  other graphical characteristics according to his taste. Knowledge
  and feeling are basic conditions for the selection and mixture of
  different font sizes, attributes and families.
\end{Explain}

\begin{Declaration}

\end{Declaration}%
\BeginIndex{Cmd}{setkomafont}%
\BeginIndex{Cmd}{addtokomafont}%
\BeginIndex{Cmd}{usekomafont}%
With\ChangedAt{v2.8p}{\Class{scrbook}\and \Class{scrreprt}\and
  \Class{scrartcl}} the help of the two commands \Macro{setkomafont}
and \Macro{addtokomafont} it is possible to define the
\PName{commands} that change the characteristics of a given
\PName{element}. Theoretically all possible statements including
literal text could be used as \PName{commands}.  You should however
absolutely limit yourself to those statements that really switch only
one font attribute. This are usually the commands \Macro{normalfont},
\Macro{rmfamily}, \Macro{sffamily}, \Macro{ttfamily},
\Macro{mdseries}, \Macro{bfseries}, \Macro{upshape}, \Macro{itshape},
\Macro{slshape}, \Macro{scshape} and the font size commands
\Macro{Huge}, \Macro{huge}, \Macro{LARGE} etc. The description of
these commands can be found in \cite{lshort}, \cite{latex:usrguide} or
\cite{latex:fntguide}. Color switching commands like
\Macro{normalcolor} (see \cite{package:graphics}) are also acceptable.
The behavior when using other commands, specially those that make
redefinitions or generate output, is not defined. Strange behavior is
possible and does not represent a bug.


The command \Macro{setkomafont } provides a font switching command
with a completely new definition. In contrast to this the
\Macro{addtokomafont} commands extends the existing definition.

It is not recommended to use both statements in the same
document.  Usage examples can be found in the paragraphs on the
corresponding element.  Names and meanings of the individual items are
listed in \autoref{tab:maincls.elementsWithoutText}.  The default
values are shown in the corresponding paragraphs.

The command \Macro{usekomafont} can change the current font
specification to the one used with the specified \PName{element}.
\begin{Example}
  Assume that you want to use for the element
  \FontElement{captionlabel} the same font specification that is used
  with \FontElement{descriptionlabel}. This can be easily done with:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \setkomafont{captionlabel}{\usekomafont{descriptionlabel}}
\end{lstlisting}
  You can find other examples in the paragraphs on each element.

\subsection{Page Style}
\label{sec:maincls.pageStyle}

\begin{Declaration}
  \Macro{pagestyle}\PParameter{empty}\\
  \XMacro{pagestyle}\PParameter{plain}\\

  \XMacro{pagestyle}\PParameter{myheadings}\\
  \Macro{thispagestyle}\Parameter{local page style}

\BeginIndex{Cmd}{thispagestyle}%
\BeginIndex{Pagestyle}{empty}%
\BeginIndex{Pagestyle}{plain}%
\BeginIndex{Pagestyle}{headings}%
\BeginIndex{Pagestyle}{myheadings}%
One of the general characteristics of a document is the page
style\Index[indexmain]{page style}. In {\LaTeX} this means mostly the
contents of headers and footers. Usually one distinguishes four
different page styles.
\begin{description}
\item[\phantomsection\label{desc:maincls.pagestyle.empty}empty] is the page
  style with entirely empty headers and footers. In {\KOMAScript} this is
  completely identical to the standard classes.
\item [plain] is the page style with empty head and only a page number
  in the foot. With the standard classes this page number is
  always centered in the foot. With {\KOMAScript} the page number
  appears on double-sided\Index {double-sided} layout on the outer
  side of the foot. The one-sided page style behaves like the
  standard setup.
\item[headings] is the page style with running titles in the head.
  With the classes \Class{scrbook}\IndexClass{scrbook} and
  \Class{scrreprt}\IndexClass{scrreprt} the titles of chapters and
  sections are repeated in the head\,---\,with {\KOMAScript} on the outer
  side, with the standard classes on the inner side.  The page number
  comes with {\KOMAScript} on the outer side of the foot, with the
  standard classes it comes on the inner side of the head.  In
  one-sided layouts only the headings of the chapters are used and
  are, with {\KOMAScript}, centered in the head. The page numbers are
  set with {\KOMAScript} centered in the foot.
  \OnlyAt{\Class{scrartcl}}\Class{scrartcl}\IndexClass{scrartcl}
  behaves similarly, but starting a level deeper in the section
  hierarchy with sections and subsections, because the chapter level
  does not exist in this case.

  While the standard classes automatically set running headings always
  in capitals, {\KOMAScript} applies the style of the title. This has
  several typographic reasons. Capitals as a decoration are actually
  too strong. If one applies them nevertheless, they should be set
  with a smaller type size and tighter spacing. The standard classes
  don't take these points in consideration.
\item [myheadings] corresponds mostly to the page style
  \PValue{headings}, but the running headings s are not automatically
  produced, but have to be defined by the user. The commands \Macro
  {markboth}\IndexCmd{markboth} and
  \Macro{markright}\IndexCmd{markright} can be used for that purpose.
\end{description}
Besides, the form of the page styles \PValue{headings} and
\PValue{myheadings} is affected by each of the four class options
\Option{headsepline}, \Option{headnosepline}, \Option{footsepline} and
\Option {footnosepline} (see \autoref{sec:maincls.layoutOptions},
\autopageref{desc:maincls.option.headsepline}).
The page style starting with the current page is changed by the
command \Macro{pagestyle}.  On the other hand \Macro{thispagestyle}
changes only the style of the current page.

The page style can be set at any time with the help of the
\Macro{pagestyle} command and takes effect with the next page that is
output. Usually one sets the page style only once at the beginning of the
document or in the preamble. To change the page style of the current
page one uses the \Macro{thispagestyle} command. This also happens at
some places in the document automatically. For example, the
instruction \Macro{thispagestyle}\PParameter{plain} is issued
implicitly on the first page of a chapter.

Please note that the change between automatic and manual running
headings is not performed by page style changes when using the
\Package{scrpage2} package, but instead special instructions must be
used. The page styles \PValue{headings} and \PValue{myheadings} should
not be used together with this package (see
\autoref{cha:scrpage},
\autopageref{desc:scrpage.pagestyle.useheadings}).

\autoref{sec:maincls.font}. The same element is used for head and
foot, which you can designate equivalently with

the page number within the head or foot is called
\FontElement{pagenumber}\IndexFontElement{pagenumber}. The default

  Assume that you want to set head and foot in a smaller type size and
  in italics. However, the page number should not be set in italics
  but bold. Apart from the fact that the result will look horribly,
  you can reach this as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \setkomafont{pagehead}{%
    \normalfont\normalcolor\itshape\small
  }
  \setkomafont{pagenumber}{\normalfont\bfseries}
\end{lstlisting}
  If you want  only that in addition to the default slanted variant a
  smaller type size is used, it is sufficient to use the following:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \addtokomafont{pagefoot}{\small}
\end{lstlisting}
  As you can see, the last example uses the element
  \FontElement{pagefoot}. You can achieve the same result using
  \PValue{pagehead} instead (see
  \autoref{tab:maincls.elementsWithoutText} on
  \autopageref{tab:maincls.elementsWithoutText}).
\end{Example}
It is not possible to use these methods to force capitals to be used
automatically for the running headings. For that, please use the
\Package{scrpage2} package (see \autoref{cha:scrpage},
\autopageref{desc:scrpage.option.markuppercase}).

If you define your own page styles, the commands
\Macro{usekomafont}\PParameter{pagehead} and
\Macro{usekomafont}\PParameter {pagenumber} can find a meaningful use.
If you use for that not the \KOMAScript{} package \Package{scrpage2}
(see \autoref{cha:scrpage}), but, for example, the package
\Package{fancyhdr}\IndexPackage{fancyhdr} (see
\cite{package:fancyhdr}), you can use these commands in your
definitions.  Thereby you can remain compatible with \KOMAScript. If
you do not use these commands in your own definitions, changes like
those shown in the previous examples have no effect. The packages
\Package{scrpage}\IndexPackage{scrpage} and
\Package{scrpage2}\IndexPackage {scrpage2} take care to keep the
maximum possible compatibility with other packages.

For some pages a different page style is chosen with the help of the
command \Macro{thispagestyle}. Which page style this actually is, is
defined by these four macros. The default values for all four cases is
\PValue{plain}. The meaning of these macros can be taken from
\autoref{tab:specialpagestyles}.

The page styles can be redefined with the \Macro{renewcommand} macro.
\begin{Example}
  Assume that you want the pages with a \Macro{part} heading to have
  no number. Then you can use the following command, for example in
  the preamble of your document:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \renewcommand*{\partpagestyle}{empty}
\end{lstlisting}
  As mentioned previously, the page style \PValue{empty} is exactly
  what is required in this example. Naturally you can also use a
  user-defined page style.

  Assume you have defined your own page style for initial chapter pages
  with the package \Package{scrpage2} (see
  \autoref{cha:scrpage}). You have given to this page style the
  fitting name \PValue{chapter}. To actually use this style, you must
  redefine the macro \Macro{chapterpagestyle} accordingly:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \renewcommand*{\chapterpagestyle}{chapter}
\end{lstlisting}

  Assume that you want that the table of contents of a book to
  have no page numbers. However,  everything after the table of
  contents should work
  again with the page style \PValue{headings}, as well as with
  \PValue{plain} on every first page of a chapter. You can use the
  following commands:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \clearpage
  \pagestyle{empty}
  \renewcommand*{\chapterpagestyle}{empty}
  \tableofcontents
  \clearpage
  \pagestyle{headings}
  \renewcommand*{\chapterpagestyle}{plain}
\end{lstlisting}
  Instead of the above you may do a local redefinition using a group. The
  advantage will be that you don't need to know the current page style before
  the change to switch back at the end.
\begin{lstlisting}
  \clearpage
  \begingroup
    \pagestyle{empty}
    \renewcommand*{\chapterpagestyle}{empty}
    \tableofcontents
    \clearpage
  \endgroup
\end{lstlisting}
  But notice that you never should put a numbered head into a group. Otherwise
  you may get funny results with commands like \Macro{label}.
\end{Example}



\begin{Explain}
  Whoever thinks that it is possible to put running headings on the
  first page of a chapter by using the command
\begin{lstlisting}
  \renewcommand*{\chapterpagestyle}{headings}
\end{lstlisting}
  will be surprised at the results.
  For sure, the page style \PValue{headings} is thereby applied to the
  initial page of a chapter. But nevertheless no running headings appear
  when using the \Option{openright} option.
  The reason for this behaviour can be found in the \LaTeX{}
  core. There, the command \Macro{rightmark}, that generates the marks
  for right-hand pages, is defined with;
\begin{lstlisting}
  \let\@rightmark\@secondoftwo
  \def\rightmark{\expandafter\@rightmark
    \firstmark\@empty\@empty}
\end{lstlisting}
  The right-hand mark is set with \Macro{firstmark}. \Macro{firstmark}
  contains the  left-hand  and right-hand  marks that were first set
  for a page. Within \Macro{chapter}, \Macro{markboth} is used to set
  the left mark to the chapter header and the right mark to empty.
  Hence, the first right
  mark on  a chapter beginning with a right-hand page is empty. Therefore,
  the running heading is also empty on those pages.

  You could redefine \Macro{rightmark} in the preamble so that the
  last mark on the page is used instead of the first:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \makeatletter
  \renewcommand*{\rightmark}{%
    \expandafter\@rightmark\botmark\@empty\@empty}
  \makeatother
\end{lstlisting}
  This would however cause the running heading of the first page of a
  chapter to use the title of the last section in the page. This is
  confusing and should be avoided.

  It is also confusing (and hence should be avoided) to have as
  running heading of the first page of a chapter the chapter title
  instead of the the section title. Therefore, the current behavior
  should be considered to be correct.

The \LaTeX{} core contains the \Macro{clearpage} command, which takes
care of the fact that all floats that have not yet been output and
starts a new page.  There exists the instruction
\Macro{cleardoublepage} which works like \Macro{clearpage} but that,
in the double-sided layouts (see layout option \Option{twoside} in
\autoref{sec:maincls.layoutOptions},
\autopageref{desc:maincls.option.twoside}) starts a new right-hand page.
An empty left page in the current page style is output if necessary.

With \Macro{cleardoublestandardpage} \KOMAScript{} works as described
above.  The \Macro{cleardoubleplainpage} command changes the page
style of the empty left page to \PValue{plain} in order to suppress
the running heading.  Analogously, the page style \PValue{empty} is
applied to the empty page with \Macro{cleardoubleemptypage},
suppressing the page number as well as the runnning title. The page is
thus entirely empty. However, the approach used by
\Macro{cleardoublepage} is dependent on the layout options
\Option{cleardoublestandard}, \Option{cleardoubleplain} and
\Option{cleardoubleempty} described in
\autoref{sec:maincls.layoutOptions},

\begin{Explain}%
  A peculiarity of \LaTeX{} consists in the fact that it is not
  possible to determine on which page the current text will fall. It
  is also difficult to say whether the current page has an odd or an
  even page number. Now some will argue that there is, nevertheless,
  the \TeX test macro \Macro{ifodd} which one needs only to apply to
  the current page counter. However, this is an error. At the time of
  the evaluation of such a test \LaTeX{} does not know at all whether
  the text just processed will be typeset on the current page or only
  on the next. The page breaks take place not while reading the paragraph,
  but only in the \emph{output} routine of \LaTeX{}. However, at that
  moment a command of the form \verb|\ifodd\value{page}| would already
  have been completely evaluated.

  To find out reliably whether a text falls on an even or odd
  page, one must usually work with a label and a page reference to
  this label. One must also take special precautionary measures during
  the first \LaTeX{} run, when the label is not yet known.
\end{Explain}
If one wants to find out with {\KOMAScript} whether a text falls on an
even or odd page, one can use the \Macro {ifthispageodd} command. The
\PName{true} argument is executed only if the command falls on an odd
page.  Otherwise the \PName{false} argument is executed.

\begin{Explain}
  More precisely stated, the question is not where the text is, but
  whether a page reference to a label placed in this location would
  refer to an odd or an even page.
\end{Explain}
\begin{Example}
  Assume that you want to indicate if an odd or even page is
  output. This could be achieved with the command:
\begin{lstlisting}
  This is a page with an \ifthispageodd{odd}{even}
  page number.
\end{lstlisting}
  The output would then be:
  \begin{quote}
    This is a page with an \ifthispageodd{odd}{even}
    page number.
  \end{quote}
\end{Example}

Because the \Macro{ifthispageodd} command uses a mechanism that is
very similar to a label and a reference to it, at least two \LaTeX{}
runs are required after every text modification. Only then the
decision is correct. In the first run a heuristic is used to make the
first choice.


\begin{Explain}
  There are situations where the \Macro{ifthispageodd} command never
  leads to the correct result. Suppose that the command is used within
  a box. A box is set by \LaTeX{} always as a whole. No page breaks
  take place inside. Assume further that the \PName{true} part is very
  big, but the \PName{false} part is empty. If we suppose further that
  the box with the \PName {false} part still fits on the current, even
  page, but that with the \PName{true} part it does not.  Further
  assume that \KOMAScript{} heuristically decides for the first run
  that the \PName{true} part applies. The decision is wrong and is
  revised in the next run. The \PName{false} part is thereby
  processed, instead of the \PName{true} part. The decision must again
  be revised in the next run and so on.

  These cases are rare. Nevertheless it should not be said that I have
  not pointed out that they are possible.

  Sometimes you need to know the state of the last decision. This may be done
  using the expert command \Macro{ifthispagewasodd}. This is either same like
  \Macro{iftrue} or \Macro{iffalse} and may be used like those.

This command works the same way in \KOMAScript{} as in the standard

numbers.  The changes take effect immediately, hence starting with the
page that contains the command.  The possible settings can be found in
\autoref{tab:numberKind}.  Using the command \Macro{pagenumbering}
also resets the page counter\Index{page counter}\Index{page number}.
Thus the page number of the next page which \TeX{} outputs will have
the number 1 in the style \PName{numbering style}.

\section{Titles}
\label{sec:maincls.titles}

\begin{Explain}
  After having described the options and some general issues, we begin
  the document where it usually begins: with the titles. The titles
  comprise everything that belongs in the widest sense to the title of
  a document. Like already mentioned in
  \autoref{sec:maincls.layoutOptions},
  \autopageref{desc:maincls.option.titlepage}, we can distinguish
  between title pages and \emph{in-page} titles. Article classes like
  \Class{article} or \Class{scrartcl} have by default \emph{in-page}
  titles, while classes like \Class{report}, \Class{book},
  \Class{scrreprt} and \Class{scrbook} have title pages as default.
  The defaults can be changed with the class options
  \Option{titlepage} and \Option{notitlepage}.
\end{Explain}


\begin{Declaration}
  \Environment{titlepage}
\end{Declaration}%
\BeginIndex{Env}{titlepage}%
With the standard classes and with {\KOMAScript} all title pages are
defined in a special environment, the \Environment{titlepage}
environment.  This environment always starts a new page\,---\,in the
two-sided layout a new right page. For this page, the style is changed
as by \Macro{thispagestyle}\PParameter{empty}, so that neither page
number nor running title are output. At the end of the environment the
page is automatically shipped out. Should you not be able to use the
automatic layout of the title page, it is advisable to design a new
one with the help of this environment.


\begin{Example}
  Assume you want a title page on which only the word " ` Me " '
  stands at the top on the left, as large as possible and in bold --
  no author, no date, nothing else. The following document makes just
  that:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \documentclass{scrbook}
  \begin{document}
  \begin{titlepage}
    \textbf{\Huge Me}
  \end{titlepage}
  \end{document}
\end{lstlisting}
  Simple? Right.
\end{Example}
%
\EndIndex{Env}{titlepage}

\begin{Declaration}
  \Macro{maketitle}\OParameter{page number}
\end{Declaration}%
\BeginIndex{Cmd}{maketitle}%
While the the standard classes produce a title page that may have the three
items title, author and date, with {\KOMAScript} the \Macro{maketitle} command
can produce up to six pages.

In contrast to the standard classes, the \Macro{maketitle} macro in
{\KOMAScript} accepts an optional numeric argument. If it is used, the number
is made the page number of the first title page.  However, this page number is
not output, but affects only the numbering. You should choose an odd number,
because otherwise the whole counting gets mixed up. In my opinion there are
only two meaningful applications for the optional argument. On the one hand,
one could give to the half-title\Index[indexmain]{half-title} the logical page
number \(-1\) in order to give the full title page the number 1. On the other
hand it could be used to start at a higher page number, for instance, 3, 5, or
7 to accommodate other title pages added by the publishing house.  The
optional argument is ignored for \emph{in-page} titles. However the page style
of such a title page can be changed by redefining the \Macro{titlepagestyle}
macro.  For that see \autoref{sec:maincls.pageStyle},
\autopageref{desc:maincls.macro.titlepagestyle}.

The following commands do not lead necessarily to the production of the
titles. The typesetting of the title pages is always done by
\Macro{maketitle}. The commands explained below only define the contents of
the title pages. It is however not necessary, and when using the
\Package{babel} package\IndexPackage{babel} not recommended, to use these in
the preamble before \Macro{begin}\PParameter{document} (see
\cite{package:babel}). Examples can be found at the end of this section.

\begin{Explain}%
\begin{Declaration}
  \Macro{extratitle}\Parameter{half-title}
\end{Declaration}%
\BeginIndex{Cmd}{extratitle}%
  In earlier times the inner book was often not protected from dirt by a cover.
  This task was then taken over by the first page of the book which
  carried mostly a shortened title, precisely the \emph{half-title}.
  Nowadays the extra page is often applied before the real full title
  and contains information on the publisher, series number and similar
  information.
\end{Explain}

With {\KOMAScript} it is possible to include a page before the real
title page.  The \PName{half-title} can be arbitrary text\,---\,even
several paragraphs. The contents of the \PName {half-title} are output
by {\KOMAScript} without additional formatting. Their organisation is
completely left to the user. The back of the half-title remains empty.
The half-title has its own title page even when \emph{in-page} titles
are used. The output of the half-title defined with \Macro{extratitle}
takes place as part of the titles produced by \Macro{maketitle}.


\begin{Example}
  Let's go back to the previous example and assume
  that the spartan "Me" is the half-title. The full title should
  still follow the half-title. One can proceed as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \documentclass{scrbook}
  \begin{document}
    \extratitle{\textbf{\Huge Me}}
    \title{It's me}
    \maketitle
  \end{document}
\end{lstlisting}
  You can  center the half-title and put it a little lower down the page:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \documentclass{scrbook}
  \begin{document}
    \extratitle{\vspace*{4\baselineskip}
      \begin{center}\textbf{\Huge Me}\end{center}}
    \title{It's me}
    \maketitle
  \end{document}
\end{lstlisting}
  The command \Macro{title} is necessary in order to make the examples
  above work correctly. It is explained next.

The contents of the full title page are defined by six elements. The
\PName{title head}\Index[indexmain]{title head} is defined with the
command \Macro {titlehead}. It is typeset in regular paragraph style
and full width at the top of the page. It can be freely designed by
the user.

The \PName{Subject}\Index[indexmain]{subject} is output immediately
above the \PName{Title}. A slightly larger font size than the regular
one is used.

The \PName{Title} is output with a very large font size.
Besides\ChangedAt{v2.8p}{%
  \Class{scrbook}\and\Class{scrreprt}\and\Class{scrartcl}} the change
of size, the settings for the element
\FontElement{title}\IndexFontElement{title} also take effect. By
default these settings are identical to the settings for the element
\FontElement{sectioning}\IndexFontElement{sectioning} (see
\autoref{tab:maincls.elementsWithoutText},
\autopageref{tab:maincls.elementsWithoutText}). The font size is however
not affected (see \autoref{tab:maincls.elementsWithoutText},
\autopageref{tab:maincls.mainTitle}). The
default settings can be changed with the commands of
\autoref{sec:maincls.font}.

Below the \PName{Title} appears the
\PName{Author}\Index[indexmain]{author}.  Several authors can be
specified in the argument of \Macro{author}. They should be separated
by \Macro{and}.

Below the author or authors appears the date\Index{date}. The default
value is the present date, as produced by
\Macro{today}\IndexCmd{today}. The \Macro{date} command accepts
arbitrary information or even an empty argument.

Finally comes the \PName{Publisher}\Index[indexmain]{publisher}. Of
course this command can also be used for any other information of
little importance. If necessary, the \Macro{parbox} command can be
used to typeset this information over the full page width like a
regular paragraph.  Then it is to be considered equivalent to the
title head. However, note that this field is put above any existing
footnotes.

Footnotes\Index{footnotes} on the title page are produced not with
\Macro{footnote}, but with \Macro{thanks}. They serve typically for
notes associated with the authors. Symbols are used as footnote
markers instead of numbers.

With the exception of \PName{titlehead} and possible footnotes, all
the items are centered horizontally.  The information is summarised in
\autoref{tab:maincls.mainTitle}.

\begin{Example}
  Assume you are writing a dissertation. The title page should have
  the university's name and address at the top, flush left, and the
  semester flush right. As usual a title is to be used, including
  author and delivery date.
  The advisor must also be indicated, together with the fact that the
  document is a dissertation. This can be obtained as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \documentclass{scrbook}
  \begin{document}
  \titlehead{{\Large Unseen University
      \hfill SS~2002\\}

  \publishers{Advisor Prof. John Excentric Doe}
  \maketitle
  \end{document}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{Example}


\begin{Explain}
A frequent misunderstanding concerns the role of the full title side.
It is often erroneous assumed that the cover (or dust cover) is meant.
Therefore, it is frequently expected that the title page does not follow
the normal page layout, but have equally large left and right margins.

However if one takes a book and opens it, one hits very quickly on at
least one title page under the cover within the so-called inner book.
Precisely these title pages are produced by \Macro{maketitle}. Like it
happens with the half-title, the full title page belongs to the inner
book, and therefore should have the same page layout as the rest of
the document.  A cover is actually something that should be created in
a separate document. The cover often has a very individual format. It
can also be designed with the help of a graphics or DTP program. A
separate document should also be used because the cover will be
printed on a different medium, possibly cardboard, and possibly with
another printer.

\BeginIndex{Env}{abstract}%
Particularly\OnlyAt{\Class{scrartcl}\and\Class{scrreprt}} with
articles, more rarely with reports, there is a summary\Index{summary}
directly under the title and before the table of contents. Therefore,
this is often considered a part of the titles. Some {\LaTeX} classes
offer a special environment for this summary, the
\Environment{abstract} environment. This is output directly, at it is
not a component of the titles set by \Macro{maketitle}.  Please note
that \Environment{abstract} is an environment, not a command. Whether
the summary has a heading or not is determined by the options
\Option{abstracton} and \Option{abstractoff} (see
\autoref{sec:maincls.formattingOptions},
\autopageref{desc:maincls.option.abstracton})

With books (\Class{scrbook}) the summary is frequently a component of
the introduction or a separate chapter at the end of the document.
Therefore no \Environment{abstract} environment is provided. When
using the class \Class{scrreprt} it is surely worth considering
whether one should not proceed likewise.

\section{The Table of Contents}
\label{sec:maincls.toc}

The titles are normally followed by the table of contents\Index{table
of contents}.
Often the table of contents is followed by lists of floats, e.g. lists
of tables and figures, see \autoref{sec:maincls.floats}).

\begin{Declaration}
  \Macro{tableofcontents}\\
  \Macro{contentsname}
\end{Declaration}%
\BeginIndex{Cmd}{tableofcontents}%
\BeginIndex{Cmd}{contentsname}%
 The production of the table of contents is done by the
\Macro{tableofcontents} command.
To get a correct table of contents, at least two \LaTeX{} runs are
necessary after every change.  The option \Option{liststotoc} causes
the lists of figures and tables to be included in the table of
contents. \Option{idxtotoc} is the corresponding option for the index.
This is rather uncommon in classical typography. One finds the
bibliography included in the table of contents a little bit more
frequently. This can be obtained with the options \Option{bibtotoc}
and \Option{bibtotocnumbered}. These options are explained in
\autoref{sec:maincls.tocOptions},
\autopageref{desc:maincls.option.liststotoc}.

\begin{Explain}
  The table of contents is set as a not numbered chapter and is therefore
  subjected to the side effects of the standard \Macro{chapter*} command,
  which are described in \autoref{sec:maincls.structure},
  \autopageref{desc:maincls.macro.chapter*}.  However, the running
  titles\Index{running title} for left and right pages are correctly filled
  with the heading of the table of contents. The text of the heading is given
  by the macro \Macro{contentsname}.
\end{Explain}%
\EndIndex{Cmd}{tableofcontents}%
\EndIndex{Cmd}{contentsname}%


There is only one variant for the construction of the table of
contents. The titles of the sectional units are indented so that the
unit number is flush left to the edge of the title of the next upper
unit.  However, the place for the numbers is thereby limited and is
only sufficient for a little bit more than 1.5 places per level.
Should this become a problem, help can be found in \cite{DANTE:FAQ}.

\begin{Explain}
The entry for the highest sectional unit below \Macro{part}, i.e.,
\Macro{chapter} with \Class{scrbook}\IndexClass{scrbook} and
\Class{scrreprt}\IndexClass{scrreprt} or \Macro{section} with
\Class{scrartcl}\IndexClass {scrartcl} is not indented. It is however
affected by the settings of the element
\FontElement{sectioning}\IndexFontElement{sectioning} (see
\autoref{tab:maincls.elementsWithoutText},
\autopageref{tab:maincls.elementsWithoutText}). There is no point
between the text of the sectional unit heading and the page number. The
typographic reasons for this are that the font is usually different
and the desire for appropriate emphasis. The table of contents of this
manual is a good example of these considerations.%
\end{Explain}

\begin{Declaration}
  \Counter{tocdepth}
\end{Declaration}%
\BeginIndex{Counter}{tocdepth}%
Normally, the units included in the table of contents are all the
units from \Macro{part} to \Macro{subsection} (for the classes
\Class{scrbook} and \Class{scrreprt}) or from \Macro{part} to
\Macro{subsubsection} (for the class \Class{scrartcl}).  The inclusion
of a sectional unit in the table of contents is controlled by the
counter \Counter{tocdepth}. It has the value \(-1\) for \Macro{part},
\(0\) for \Macro{chapter} and so on. Since the class \Class{scrartcl} has
no \Macro{chapter}, the counter starts with 0 for the \Macro{part}. By
setting, incrementing or decrementing the counter, one can choose the
lowest sectional unit level to be included in the table of contents.
The same happens with the standard classes.

The user of the \Package{scrpage2}\IndexPackage{scrpage2} package (see
\autoref{cha:scrpage}) does not need to remember the numerical
values of each sectional unit. They are given by the values of the
macros \Macro{chapterlevel}, \Macro{sectionlevel} and so on down to
\Macro{subparagraphlevel}.
\begin{Example}
  Assume that you are preparing an article that uses the sectional
  unit \Macro{subsubsection}. However, you don't want this sectional
  unit to appear in the table of contents. The preamble of your
  document might contain the following:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \documentclass{scrartcl}
  \setcounter{tocdepth}{2}
\end{lstlisting}
You set the counter \Counter{tocdepth} to 2, because you know that
this is the value for \Macro{subsection}. If you know that
\Class{scrartcl} normally includes all levels up to
\Macro{subsubsection} in the table of contents, you can simply
decrement the counter \Counter{tocdepth} by one:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \documentclass{scrartcl}
  \addtocounter{tocdepth}{-1}
\end{lstlisting}
How much you should add to or take from the \Counter{tocdepth} counter
can also be found by looking at the table of contents after the first
\LaTeX{} run.
\end{Example}
%
\EndIndex{Counter}{tocdepth}%

\section{Lists of Floats}

As a rule, the lists of floats\index{float environments},
e.g. list of tables\index{list of tables} and
list of figures\index{list of figures}, can be found directly
after the table of contents.
In some documents, they even can be found in the appendix.
However, the author of this manual prefers the location
after the table of contents, therefore it is discussed here.

\begin{Declaration}
  \Macro{listoftables}\\
  \Macro{listoffigures}\\
  \Macro{listtablename}\\
  \Macro{listfigurename}
\end{Declaration}
\BeginIndex{Cmd}{listoftables}%
\BeginIndex{Cmd}{listoffigures}%
\BeginIndex{Cmd}{listtablename}%
\BeginIndex{Cmd}{listfigurename}%
These commands generate a list of tables or figures.  Changes in the document,
that modify these lists will require two \LaTeX{} runs in order to take
effect.  The layout of the lists can be influenced by the options
\Option{listsindent} and \Option{listsleft}, see
\autoref{sec:maincls.listsOptions},
\autopageref{desc:maincls.option.listsleft}.  Moreover, the options
\Option{liststotoc} and \Option{liststotocnumbered} have indirect influence,
see \autoref{sec:maincls.tocOptions},
\autopageref{desc:maincls.option.liststotoc}).

\begin{Explain}
The terms of the titles of this tables are stored at the macros
\Macro{listtablename} and \Macro{listfigurename}. If you're using a language
package like \Package{babel} and want to change these terms, you should read
the documentation of the language package.
\end{Explain}

\EndIndex{Cmd}{listfigurename}%


\section{Main Text}
\label{sec:maincls.mainText}

This section explains everything provided by \KOMAScript{}
in order to write the main text. The main text is the
part that the author should focus on first.
Of course this includes tables, figures and comparable
information as well.

\subsection{Separation}{Separation\protect\OnlyAt{\Class{scrbook}}}
\label{sec:maincls.separation}

Before\OnlyAt{\Class{scrbook}} getting to the main text eventually we will
have a short look at three commands which exist both in the standard class
\Class{book} and the {\KOMAScript} class \Class{scrbook}. They are used for
separation of the \emph{font matter}\Index{front matter}, the \emph{main
  matter}\Index{main matter} and the \emph{back matter}\Index{back matter} of
a book.

\begin{Declaration}
  \Macro{frontmatter}\\
  \Macro{mainmatter}\\
  \Macro{backmatter}
\end{Declaration}%
\BeginIndex{Cmd}{frontmatter}%
\BeginIndex{Cmd}{mainmatter}%
\BeginIndex{Cmd}{backmatter}%
The macro \Macro{frontmatter} introduces the font matter in which roman
numbers are used for the page numbers. Chapter headings in a front matter
don't have any numbers.  The foreword can be set as a normal chapter.
A foreword should never be divided into sections but kept short.
Therefore there is no need for a deeper structuring than chapter.

\Macro{mainmatter} introduces the main matter with the main text. If there is
no fton matter this command can be omitted. The default in the main matter is
arabic page numbering (re)starting with 1.

The back matter is introduced with \Macro{backmatter}. Opinions differ in
what should be part of the back matter. So in some cases you will only find
the bibliography\Index{bibliography}, in some cases only the
index\Index{index} and in other cases both of it and the appendix.
Besides, the chapters at the back matter are similar to the chapters at the
front matter, but page numbering doesn't change. Nevertheless you may use
command \Macro{pagenumbering} from \autoref{sec:maincls:pageStyle},
\autopageref{desc:maincls.macro.pagenumbering} of you want to change this.

\EndIndex{Cmd}{frontmatter}%
\EndIndex{Cmd}{mainmatter}%
\EndIndex{Cmd}{backmatter}%


\subsection{Structuring the Document}\Index[indexmain]{structuring}
\label{sec:maincls.structure}

There are several commands to structure a document into parts, chapters,
sections and so on.

\begin{Declaration}
  \Macro{part}\OParameter{Short version}\Parameter{Heading}\\
  \Macro{chapter}\OParameter{Short version}\Parameter{Heading}\\
  \Macro{section}\OParameter{Short version}\Parameter{Heading}\\
  \Macro{subsection}\OParameter{Short version}\Parameter{Heading}\\
  \Macro{subsubsection}\OParameter{Short version}\Parameter{Heading}\\
  \Macro{paragraph}\OParameter{Short version}\Parameter{Heading}\\
  \Macro{subparagraph}\OParameter{Short version}\Parameter{Heading}
\end{Declaration}%
\BeginIndex{Cmd}{part}%
\BeginIndex{Cmd}{chapter}%
\BeginIndex{Cmd}{section}%
\BeginIndex{Cmd}{subsection}%
\BeginIndex{Cmd}{subsubsection}%
\BeginIndex{Cmd}{paragraph}%
\BeginIndex{Cmd}{subparagraph}%
The standard sectioning commands in {\KOMAScript} work quite similar
to the standard classes. Normally the section headings show up in the
table of contents exactly as they are entered in the text. The entry
for the table of contents can be specified as an optional argument in
front of the actual heading.
\OnlyAt{\Class{scrartcl}}\Macro{chapter} only exists in book or
report classes but not in article classes. In addition to this, the
command \Macro{chapter} in {\KOMAScript} differs substantially from
the version in the standard class. While in the standard classes every
chapter number is used together with the prefix ``Chapter'' on a
separate line above the heading, {\KOMAScript} only places the chapter
number in front of the heading.

Please note that \Macro{part} and \Macro{chapter} change the page
style for one page. The applied page style in \KOMAScript{} is defined
in \Macro{partpagestyle} and \Macro{chapterpagestyle} (see
\autoref{sec:maincls.pageStyle},
\autopageref{desc:maincls.macro.titlepagestyle}).

\BeginIndex[indexother]{}{font}%
\BeginIndex[indexother]{}{font size}%
The font of all headings\ChangedAt{v2.8p}{%
  \Class{scrbook}\and\Class{scrreprt}\and\Class{scrartcl}} %
can be changed with the commands
\Macro{setkomafont}\IndexCmd{setkomafont} and
\Macro{addtokomafont}\IndexCmd{addtokomafont} described in
\autoref{sec:maincls.font}. First of all the element
\FontElement{sectioning}\IndexFontElement{sectioning} is used, which
is followed by a specific element for every section level (see
\autoref{tab:maincls.elementsWithoutText},
\autopageref{tab:maincls.elementsWithoutText}). The font for the element
\FontElement{sectioning}\IndexFontElement{sectioning} is predefined as
\Macro{normalfont}\Macro{normalcolor}\Macro{sffamily}%
\Macro{bfseries}. The default font size for the specific elements depends
on the options \Option{bigheadings}, \Option{normalheadings} and
\Option{smallheadings} (see \autoref{sec:maincls.fontOptions},
\autopageref{desc:maincls.option.smallheadings}). The
defaults are listed in \autoref{tab:maincls.structureElementsFont}

\end{table}

\begin{Example}
  Suppose you are using the class option \Option{bigheadings} and notice
  that the very big headings of document parts are to bold. You could change
  this as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \setkomafont{sectioning}{\normalcolor\sffamily}
  \part{Appendices}
  \addtokomafont{sectioning}{\bfseries}
\end{lstlisting}
  Using the command above you only switch off the font attribute
  \textbf{bold} for the heading ``Appendices''. A much more comfortable
  and elegant solution is to change all \Macro{part} headings in one go.
  This is done either by:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \addtokomafont{part}{\normalfont\sffamily}
  \addtokomafont{partnumber}{\normalfont\sffamily}
\end{lstlisting}
  or using:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \addtokomafont{part}{\mdseries}
  \addtokomafont{partnumber}{\mdseries}
\end{lstlisting}
  The last version is to be preferred because it gives you the correct
  result even when you change the \FontElement{sectioning}
  element\IndexFontElement{sectioning} as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \setkomafont{sectioning}{\normalcolor\bfseries}
\end{lstlisting}
  With this change it is possible to set all section levels at once to not
  longer use sans serif fonts.
\end{Example}

Please be warned of using the possibilities of font switching to mix fonts,
font sizes and font attributes excessively. Picking the most suitable font for
a given task is a hard thing even for professionals and has nothing to do with
personal taste of beginners. Please refer to the citation at the end of
\autoref{sec:typearea.tips}, \autopageref{sec:typearea.tips.cite} and the
following explanation.

\begin{Explain}
  It is possible to use different font types for different section levels
  in {\KOMAScript}. As a typographical beginner you should refrain from
  using these possibilities for typographical reasons.

  There is a rule which states that you should mix fonts only as few as
  possible. Using sans serif for headings seems already a breach of this
  rule. However, you should know that bold, huge and serif letters are much to
  heavy for headings. In general you would have to use a normal instead of a
  bold or semi bold font. However, in deeper levels of the structuring a
  normal font appears rather leight weighted. On the other hand sans serif
  fonts in headings have a very pleasant appearance and are to be used only in
  headings. That's why sans serif is the default in {\KOMAScript}. 

  More variety should be avoided. Font mixing is only for professionals. In
  case you want to use other fonts than the standard \TeX-Fonts\,---\,no matter
  whether using CM \Index{CM fonts} or EC fonts\Index{EC fonts}\,---\,you should
  consult an expert or redefine the font for the element
  \FontElement{sectioning}\IndexFontElement{sectioning} as seen in the example
  above. You often find the combinations Times and Helvetica or Palatino with
  Helvetica. The author of this documentation does not favour these
  combinations.

All sectioning commands exist as ``starred'' versions. They produce
section headings which do not show up in the table of
contents\Index{table of contents}, in the page header\Index{header}
and which are not numbered\Index{numbering}. Not using a headline
often has an unwanted side effect. For example, if a chapter which is
set using \Macro{chapter*} spans over several pages the headline of
the chapter before comes up again. {\KOMAScript} offers a solution
which is described below.
\OnlyAt{\Class{scrartcl}}\Macro{chapter*} only exists in book and
report classes which includes \Class{book}, \Class{scrbook},
\Class{report} and \Class{scrreport}, but not the article classes
\Class{article} and \Class{scrartcl}.

Please note that \Macro{part} and \Macro{chapter} change the page
style for one page. The applied style is defined in
\Macro{partpagestyle} and \Macro{chapterpagestyle} in \KOMAScript{}
(see \autoref{sec:maincls.pageStyle},
\autopageref{desc:maincls.macro.titlepagestyle}).

In addition to the standard classes {\KOMAScript} offers the new
commands \Macro{addsec} and \Macro{addchap}. They are similar to the
standard commands \Macro{chapter} und \Macro{section} except the
missing numbering. The produce both a running headline and an entry in
the table of contents. The starred versions \Macro{addchap*} and
\Macro{addsec*} are similar to the standard commands \Macro{chapter*}
and \Macro{section*} apart from a tiny but important difference: The
headlines are deleted. This eliminates the side effect of obsolete
headers mentioned above. \OnlyAt{\Class{scrartcl}}\Macro{addchap}
and \Macro{addchap*} of course only exist in book and report classes,
namely \Class{book}, \Class{scrbook}, \Class{report} and
\Class{scrreport}, but not in the article classes \Class{article} and
\Class{scrartcl}.

Similar to this, the command \Macro{addpart} produces an unnumbered
document part with an entry in the table of contents. Since the
headers are already deleted by \Macro{part} and \Macro{part*} the
problem of obsolete headers doesn't exist. The starred version
\Macro{addpart*} is identical to \Macro{part*} and is only defined for
consistency reasons.

Please note that \Macro{addpart} and \Macro{addchap} including their
starred versions change the page style for one page. The particular
page style is defined in the macros \Macro{partpagestyle} and
\Macro{chapterpagestyle} (see \autoref{sec:maincls.pageStyle},

  \Macro{minisec}\Parameter{Heading}
\end{Declaration}%
\BeginIndex{Cmd}{minisec}%
Sometimes a heading\Index{heading} is wanted which is highlighted but
closely linked to the following text. Such a heading shouldn't be
separated by a vertical skip.

The command \Macro{minisec} is designed for this situation. This heading
isn't linked to a level of structuring. Such a \emph{Mini-section}
does not produce an entry in the table of contents nor does it receive
any numbering.
\begin{Example}
  You have developed a kit for building a mouse trap and want the
  documentation separated into the things needed and an assembly
  description. Using \Macro{minisec} you could write the following:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \minisec{Items needed}

  \begin{flushleft}
    1 plank ($100\times 50 \times 12$)\\
    1 spring-plug of a beer-bottle\\
    1 spring of a ball-point pen\\
    1 drawing pin\\
    2 screws\\
    1 hammer\\
    1 knife
  \end{flushleft}

  \minisec{Assembly}
  At first one searches the mouse-hole and puts the 
  drawing pin directly behind the hole.
  Thus the mouse cannot escape meanwhile the following
  actions.

  Afterwards one knocks in the spring-plug with the hammer
  in the mouse-hole.
  If the spring-plug's size is not big enough in order to
  shut the mouse-hole entirely, then one can utilize
  the plank instead and fasten it with the two screws
  employing the knife on the mouse-hole.
  Instead of the knife one can use a screw-driver as well.
\end{lstlisting}
  Which gives:
  \begin{ShowOutput}[\baselineskip]\setlength{\parindent}{1em}
    \minisec{Items needed}

  \begin{flushleft}
    1 plank ($100\times 50 \times 12$)\\
    1 spring-plug of a beer-bottle\\
    1 spring of a ball-point pen\\
    1 drawing pin\\
    2 screws\\
    1 hammer\\
    1 knife
  \end{flushleft}

    \minisec{Assembly}
  At first one searches the mouse-hole and puts the drawing pin
  directly behind the hole. Thus the mouse cannot escape
  meanwhile the following actions.

  Afterwards one knocks in the spring-plug with the hammer
  in the mouse-hole.
  If the spring-plug's size is not big enough in order to
  shut the mouse-hole entirely, then one can utilize
  the plank instead and fasten it with the two screws
  employing the knife on the mouse-hole.
  Instead of the knife one can use a screw-driver as well.
  \end{ShowOutput}
\end{Example}

The font type of the sectioning command \Macro{minisec} can only be
changed using the element
\FontElement{sectioning}\IndexFontElement{sectioning} (see
\autoref{tab:maincls.elementsWithoutText},
\autopageref{tab:maincls.elementsWithoutText}). There is no specific
element for \Macro{minisec}. This means you can't change the font size
manually.

\begin{Declaration}
  \Macro{raggedsection}
\end{Declaration}%
\BeginIndex{Cmd}{raggedsection}%
In the standard classes headings are set as justified text. That means
that hyphenated words can occur and headings with more than one line
are stretched up to the text border. This is a rather uncommon
approach in typography. {\KOMAScript} formats the headings left
aligned with hanging indentation using \Macro{raggedsection} with the
definition:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \newcommand*{\raggedsection}{\raggedright}
\end{lstlisting}
This command can be redefined with \Macro{renewcommand}.
\begin{Example}
  You prefer justified headings. You write in the preamble of your document:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \renewcommand*{\raggedsection}{}
\end{lstlisting}
  or short:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \let\raggedsection\relax
\end{lstlisting}
  You will get a formatting of the headings which is very close to the
  standard classes. Even closer it will get when you combine this change
  with the change of the element
  \FontElement{sectioning}\IndexFontElement{sectioning} mentioned
  above.

  As you might know, for every counter in {\LaTeX} there is a command
  \Macro{the}\PName{counter name}, which gives you the value of the
  counter. Depending on the class the counter for a particular level
  starting from \Macro{section} (\Class{book}, \Class{scrbook},
  \Class{report}, \Class{scrreprt}) or \Macro{subsection}
  (\Class{article}, \Class{scrartcl}) is composed of the counter for the
  higher level followed by a dot and the arabic number of the
  \PName{counter name} of the respective level.\par
\end{Explain}

\KOMAScript{} has added to the output of the section number a further
logical level. The counter for the respective heading are formatted
using \Macro{partformat}, \Macro{chapterformat} and
\Macro{othersectionlevelsformat}.
\OnlyAt{\Class{scrbook}\and\Class{scrreprt}}Of course the command
\Macro{chapterformat} doesn't exist in the class \Class{scrartcl}.

As described in \autoref{sec:maincls.formattingOptions},
\autopageref{desc:maincls.option.pointlessnumbers}
{\KOMAScript} handles dots in section numbers according to
\cite{DUDEN}. The command \Macro{autodot} makes sure that these rules
are being followed. Except from \Macro{part} in all levels a dot is
followed by a \Macro{enskip}.  This is similar to a horizontal skip of
\(0.5\Unit{em}\).

The command \Macro{othersectionlevelsformat} takes the name of the
section level, such as ``\PName{section}'', ``\PName{subsection}''
\dots{}, as parameter. As default, only the levels \Macro{part} and
\Macro{chapter} have formatting commands on their own, while all other
section levels are covered by one formatting command only. This has
historical reasons. At the time Werner Lemberg suggested a suitable
extension of {\KOMAScript} for his \Package{CJK} package, only this
differentiation was needed.

The formatting commands can be redefined using \Macro{renewcommand} to
fit them to your personal needs. The following original definitions
are used by the {\KOMAScript} classes:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \newcommand*{\partformat}{\partname~\thepart\autodot}
  \newcommand*{\chapterformat}{%
    \chapappifchapterprefix{\ }\thechapter\autodot\enskip}
  \newcommand*{\othersectionlevelsformat}[1]{%
    \csname the#1\endcsname\autodot\enskip}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{Example}
  Assume you don't want the word ``Part'' written in front of the part number.
  You could use the following command in the preamble of your document:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \renewcommand*{\partformat}{\thepart\autodot}
\end{lstlisting}
  In fact, you could do without \Macro{autodot} at this point and insert
  a fixed point instead. As \Macro{part} is numbered with roman numbers,
  according to \cite{DUDEN} a dot has to be applied. However, you would
  give up the possibility to use one of the options
  \Option{pointednumbers} und \Option{pointlessnumbers} then. More
  details concerning class options you can find in
  \autoref{sec:maincls.formattingOptions},
  \autopageref{desc:maincls.option.pointlessnumbers}).
  
  An additional possibility could be to place the section numbers
  in the left margin. That can be done in a way that the heading
  text is left aligned with the surrounding text.
  This can be accomplished with:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \renewcommand*{\othersectionlevelsformat}[1]{%
      \llap{\csname the#1\endcsname\autodot\enskip}}
\end{lstlisting}
  The almost unknown command \Macro{llap} in the definition above,
  puts its argument left to the current possition without changing the
  position. A much better \LaTeX{} solution would be:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \renewcommand*{\othersectionlevelsformat}[1]{%
    \makebox[0pt][r]{%
      \csname the#1\endcsname\autodot\enskip}}
\end{lstlisting}
  See \cite{latex:usrguide} for more information about the optional arguments
  of \Macro{makebox}.

interface. Using the layout option \Option{chapterprefix} (see
\autoref{sec:maincls.layoutOptions},

\Macro{chapappifchapterprefix} issues the word
``Chapter''\Index{chapter} in the main part of your document in the
current language followed by \PName{additional text}. In the
appendix\Index{appendix} instead, the word ``Appendix'' in the current
language followed by \PName{additional text} is issued. Having set the
option \Option{nochapterprefix} there is no additional output.

The command \Macro{chapapp} always issues the word ``Chapter'' or
``Appendix''.  In this case the options \Option{chapterprefix} and
\Option{nochapterprefix} have no effect.

Since chapters only exist in the classes \Class{scrbook} and
\Class{scrreprt} these commands only exist in these classes.

  As mentioned in \autoref{sec:maincls.pageStyle} the page style
  \PValue{headings} works with running heads\Index{running
  head}. For this, the commands \Macro{chaptermark} and
  \Macro{sectionmark} as well as \Macro{sectionmark} and
  \Macro{subsectionmark} respectively are defined. Every sectioning
  command (\Macro{chapter}, \Macro{section}, \Macro{subsection} \dots)
  automatically carries out the respective \Macro{\dots mark} command.
  The parameter handed over takes the text of the section
  heading\Index{heading}. The respective section number is added
  automatically to the \Macro{\dots mark} command. The formatting is done
  according to the section level with the command
  \Macro{chaptermarkformat}, \Macro{sectionmarkformat} or
  \Macro{subsectionmarkformat}.
  \OnlyAt{\Class{scrbook}\and\Class{scrreprt}}Of course there is no
  command \Macro{chaptermark} or \Macro{chaptermarkformat} in
  \Class{scrartcl}. \OnlyAt{\Class{scrartcl}}Accordingly
  \Macro{subsectionmark} and the command \Macro{subsectionmarkformat}
  only exist in \Class{scrartcl}. This changes when you use the
  \Package{scrpage2} package (see \autoref{cha:scrpage}).\par
\end{Explain}
Similar to \Macro{chapterformat} and \Macro{othersectionlevelsformat} the
commands \Macro{chaptermarkformat} (not at \Class{scrartcl}),
\Macro{sectionmarkformat} and the command \Macro{subsectionmarkformat}
(only at \Class{scrartcl}) define the formatting of the section numbers
in running heads. They can be adapted to your personal needs with
\Macro{renewcommand}. The original definitions from the {\KOMAScript}
classes are:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \newcommand*{\chaptermarkformat}{%
    \chapappifchapterprefix{\ }\thechapter\autodot\enskip}
  \newcommand*{\sectionmarkformat}{\thesection\autodot\enskip}
  \newcommand*{\subsectionmarkformat}{%
    \thesubsection\autodot\enskip}
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{Example}
  Suppose you want to combine the chapter number in the header with the word
  ``Chapter''. For example you could insert in the preamble of your
  document the following definition:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \renewcommand*{\chaptermarkformat}{%
    \chapapp~\thechapter\autodot\enskip}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{Example}
As you can see both the commands \Macro{chapappifchapterprefix} and
\Macro{chapapp} explained above are used.

to \Macro{subsection}\IndexCmd{subsection} and in the class

This is controlled by the \LaTeX\ counter \Counter{secnumdepth}. The
value \(-1\) represents \Macro{part}, \(0\) the level \Macro{chapter}

counting in this class starts with \(0\) at the level \Macro{part}. By
way of defining, decrementing or incrementing this counter you can

Parts\OnlyAt{\Class{scrbook}\and\Class{scrreprt}} and chapters in
{\KOMAScript} can be started with a \PName{preamble}. This is
particularily useful when you are using a two column layout with the
class option \Option{twocolumn}\IndexOption{twocolumn}. Together with
the heading the \PName{preamble} is always set in a one column layout.
The \PName{preamble} can comprise more than one paragraph. The command
for issuing the \PName{preamble} has to be put in front of the
respective \Macro{part}, \Macro{addpart}, \Macro{chapter} or
\Macro{addchap} command.
\begin{Example}
  You are writing a report on the situation of a company. You organize
  the report in such a way that every department gets its own partial report.
  Every one of these parts should be introduced by a short abstract on the
  title page. You could write the following:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \setpartpreamble{%
    \begin{abstract}
      This is a blind text. This text should show, how a
      printed text will look like at this place. If you
      read this text, you will get no information.
    \end{abstract}
  }
  \part{Department for Word Processing}
\end{lstlisting}
  Depending on the settings for the heading\Index{heading} (see
  \autoref{sec:maincls.fontOptions},
  \autopageref{desc:maincls.option.smallheadings}) size and the
  \Environment{abstract} environment\IndexEnv{abstract} (see
  \autoref{sec:maincls.formattingOptions},
  \autopageref{desc:maincls.option.abstracton}), the result would look similar
  to:
  \begin{ShowOutput}\centering

      you will get no information.
    \end{quote}
  \end{ShowOutput}
\end{Example}
Please note that it is \emph{you} who is responsible for the spaces
between the heading, preamble and the following text. Please note also
that there is no \Environment{abstract} environment in the class
\Class{scrbook} (see \autoref{sec:maincls.titles},
\autopageref{desc:maincls.environment.abstract}).

The\ChangedAt{v2.8p}{\Class{scrbook}\and\Class{scrreprt}} first
optional argument \PName{position} determines the position at which
the preamble is placed with the help of one or two letters. For the
vertical placement there are two possibilities at present:
\begin{description}
\item [\quad\texttt{o}:] above the heading
\item [\quad\texttt{u}:] below the heading
\end{description}
You can insert a preamble both above and below a heading. For the
horizontal placement you have the choice between three alignments:
\begin{description}
\item [\quad\texttt{l}:] left-aligned
\item [\quad\texttt{r}:] right-aligned
\item [\quad\texttt{c}:] centered
\end{description}
However, this does not issue the text of the \PName{preamble} but
inserts a box whose width is determined by the second optional
argument \PName{width}. If you leave out this second argument the
whole text width is used. In this case the option for horizontal
positioning will have no effect. You can combine one letter from the
vertical with one letter from the horizontal positioning.

\ChangedAt{v2.8q}{\Class{scrbook}\and\Class{scrreprt}} from an
introducing paragraph you can use \Macro{setpartpreamble} or
\Macro{setchapterpreamble} for a kind of
\PName{aphorism}\Index{aphorism} (also known as ``dictum'') at the
beginning of a chapter or section. The command \Macro{dictum} inserts
such an aphorism. This macro can be used as obligatory argument of
either the command \Macro{setchapterpreamble} or
\Macro{setpartpreamble}. However, this is not obligatory.

The dictum together with an optional \PName{author} is inserted in a
\Macro{parbox}\IndexCmd{parbox} (see \cite{latex:usrguide}) of the
width \Macro{dictumwidth}. Yet \Macro{dictumwidth} is not a length
which is set with \Macro{setlength}. It is a macro that can be
redefined using \Macro{renewcommand}. Default setting is
\verb;0.3333\textwidth;, which is a third of the textwidth. The box
itself is positioned with the command \Macro{raggeddictum}. Default
here is \Macro{raggedleft}\IndexCmd{raggedleft}.  The command
\Macro{raggeddictum} can be redefined using \Macro{renewcommand}.

Within the box the \PName{dictum} is set using
\Macro{raggeddictumtext}.  Default setting is
\Macro{raggedright}\IndexCmd{raggedright}. Similar to
\Macro{raggeddictum} it can be redefined with \Macro{renewcommand}.
The output uses the default font which is set for the element
\FontElement{dictumtext}. It can be changed with the commands from
\autoref{sec:maincls.font}. Default settings are listed in
\autoref{tab:maincls.dictumfont}.

If there is an \PName{author} it is separated from the \PName{dictum}
by a line with the width of the \Macro{parbox}. This is defined by the
macro \Macro{raggeddictumauthor}. Default is \Macro{raggedleft}. This
command can also be redefined using \Macro{renewcommand}. The format
of the output is defined with \Macro{dictumauthorformat}. This macro
expects the \Macro{author} as argument. As default
\Macro{dictumauthorformat} is defined as:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \newcommand*{\dictumauthorformat}[1]{(#1)}
\end{lstlisting}
Thus the \PName{author} is set in in round parenthesis. For the
element \FontElement{dictumauthor} a different font as for the element
\FontElement{dictumtext} can be defined. Default settings are listed
in \autoref{tab:maincls.dictumfont}. Changes can be made using the
commands from \autoref{sec:maincls.font}.

  \caption{Default settings for the elements of a dictum}

    \Macro{itshape}\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \label{tab:maincls.dictumfont}
\end{table}
%
If \Macro{dictum} is used within the macro \Macro{setchapterpreamble}
or \Macro{setpartpreamble} you have to take care of the following: The
horizontal positioning is always done with \Macro{raggeddictum}.
Therefore, the optional argument for horizontal positioning, which is
implemented for these two commands, has no effect. \Macro{textwidth}
is not the width of the whole text corpus but the actually used text
width.  If \Macro{dictumwidth} is set to \verb;.5\textwidth; and
\Macro{setchapterpreamble} has an optional width of
\verb;.5\textwidth; too, you will get a box with a width of a quarter
of the text width.  Therefore, if you use \Macro{dictum} it is
recommended to refrain from setting the optional width for
\Macro{setchapterpreamble} or \Macro{setpartpreamble}.

If you have more than one dictum you should separate them by an
additional vertical space. You could easely use the command
\Macro{bigskip}\IndexCmd{bigskip} for that.

\begin{Example}
  You are writing a chapter on an aspect of weather forecasting. You
  have come across an aphorism which you would like to place at the
  beginning of the chapter beneath the heading. You could write:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \setchapterpreamble[u]{%
    \dictum[Anonymous]{Forecasting is the art of saying
            what is going to happen and then to explain
            why it didn't.}}
  \chapter{Weather forecasting}
\end{lstlisting}
  The output would look as follows:
  \begin{ShowOutput}
    {\usekomafont{sectioning}\usekomafont{chapter}%
      17\enskip Weather forecasting\par} \vspace{\baselineskip}
    \dictum[Anonymous]{Forecasting is the art of saying what is going to
    happen and then to explain why it didn't.}
  \end{ShowOutput}

  If you would rather prefer the dictum to span over only a quarter of
  the text width you can redefine \Macro{dictumwidth}:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \renewcommand*{\dictumwidth}{.25\textwidth}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{Example}

For a somewhat more sophisticated formatting of left- or right-aligned
paragraphs including hyphenation you can use the

Formatting footnotes in {\KOMAScript} is slightly different to the
standard classes. As in the standard classes the footnote mark in the
text is formed as a small number in superscript. The same formatting
is used in the footnote itself.

The mark in the footnote is type-set right-aligned in a box
with width \PName{mark width}. The first line of the footnote
follows directly.

All following lines will be indented by the length of
\PName{indent}. If the optional parameter \PName{mark width}
was not specified, then it defaults to \PName{indent}.
If the footnote consists of more than one paragraph, then the
first line of a paragraph is indented in addition to \PName{indent}
by the value of \PName{parindent}.

Figure \ref{fig:maincls.deffootnote} illustrates the layout parameters
ones more. The default configuration of \KOMAScript{} is:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \deffootnote[1em]{1.5em}{1em}
    {\textsuperscript{\thefootnotemark}}
\end{lstlisting}
\Macro{textsuperscript} causes both the superscript and the smaller
font size. \Macro{thefootnotemark} is the current footnote mark
without any formatting.

The\ChangedAt{v2.8q}{%
  \Class{scrbook}\and\Class{scrreprt}\and\Class{scrartcl}} font element
\FontElement{footnote}\IndexFontElement{footnote} determines the font
of the footnote including the footnote mark. Using the element
\FontElement{footnotelabel}\IndexFontElement{footnotelabel} the font
of the footnote mark can be changed separately with the commands
mentioned in \autoref{sec:maincls.font} Please refer also to the
\autoref{tab:maincls.elementsWithoutText},
\autopageref{tab:maincls.elementsWithoutText}. Default setting is no
changing of the font.

The footnote mark in the text is defined separately with
\Macro{deffootnotemark}. Default setting is:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \deffootnotemark{%
    \textsuperscript{\thefootnotemark}}
\end{lstlisting}
Above\ChangedAt{v2.8q}{%
  \Class{scrbook}\and\Class{scrreprt}\and\Class{scrartcl}} the font
for the element
\FontElement{footnotereference}\IndexFontElement{footnotereference} is
applied (see \autoref{tab:maincls.elementsWithoutText},
\autopageref{tab:maincls.elementsWithoutText}). Thus the
footnote marks in the text and the footnote itself are identical. The
font can be changed with the commands described in
\autoref{sec:maincls.font}.

\begin{Example}
  A feature often asked for are footnote marks which are neither in
  superscript nor in a smaller font size. They should not touch the
  footnote text but have a small space in between. This can be
  accomplished as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \deffootnote{1em}{1em}{\thefootnotemark\ }
\end{lstlisting}
  The footnote mark and the space is set right-aligned into a
  box of the width 1\Unit{em}. The following lines of the footnote
  text is also indented by 1\Unit{em} from the left margin.
 
  Another often requested footnote layout are left-aligned
  footnote marks. These can be reached with:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \deffootnote{1.5em}{1em}{%
      \makebox[1.5em][l]{\thefootnotemark}}
\end{lstlisting}
  
  If you want however change the font for all footnotes, for example
  to sans serif, you can simply solve this problem using the commands
  from \autoref{sec:maincls.fontOptions}:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \setkomafont{footnote}{\sffamily}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{Example}
As demonstrated with the examples above the simple user interface of
{\KOMAScript} provides a great variety of different footnote
formattings.

\subsection{Lists}
\label{sec:maincls.lists} \BeginIndex[indexother]{}{lists}

Both {\LaTeX} and the standard classes offer different environments
for lists. Though slightly changed or extended all these list are of
course offered in {\KOMAScript} as well. In general all lists\,---\,even
of different kind\,---\,can be nested up to four levels. From a
typographical view, anything more would make no sense. Even more than
three levels are hard to perceive. Recommendation in these cases is to
split your huge list in several small ones.

\begin{Declaration}
  \Environment{itemize}\\
  \Macro{item}\\
  \Macro{labelitemi}\\
  \Macro{labelitemii}\\
  \Macro{labelitemiii}\\
  \Macro{labelitemiv}
\end{Declaration}%
\BeginIndex{Env}{itemize}%
\BeginIndex{Cmd}{item}%
\BeginIndex{Cmd}{labelitemi}%
\BeginIndex{Cmd}{labelitemii}%
\BeginIndex{Cmd}{labelitemiii}%
\BeginIndex{Cmd}{labelitemiv}%
The most simple form of a list is an \Environment{itemize} list.
Depending on the level {\KOMAScript} uses the following marks:
"`{\labelitemi}"', "`{\labelitemii}"', "`{\labelitemiii}"' and
"`{\labelitemiv}"'. The definition of these symbols is specified in
the macros \Macro{labelitemi}, \Macro{labelitemii},
\Macro{labelitemiii} and \Macro{labelitemiv}. All of this macros can
be redefined using \Macro{renewcommand}. Every item is introduced with
\Macro{item}.
\begin{Example}
  You have a simple list which is nested in several levels. You write
  for example:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \minisec{Vehicles}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item aeroplans
    \begin{itemize}
      \item biplane
      \item jets
      \item transport planes
      \begin{itemize}
        \item single-engined
        \begin{itemize}
          \item{jet-driven}
          \item{propeller-driven}
        \end{itemize}
        \item multi-engined
      \end{itemize}
      \item helicopter
    \end{itemize}
    \item automobiles
    \begin{itemize}
      \item racing car
      \item private car
      \item lorry
    \end{itemize}
    \item bicycles
  \end{itemize}
\end{lstlisting}
  As output you get:
  \begin{ShowOutput}[\baselineskip]
  \minisec{Vehicles}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item aeroplans
    \begin{itemize}
      \item biplane
      \item jets
      \item transport planes
      \begin{itemize}
        \item single-engined
        \begin{itemize}
          \item{jet-driven}
          \item{propeller-driven}
        \end{itemize}
        \item multi-engined
      \end{itemize}
      \item helicopter
    \end{itemize}
    \item automobiles
    \begin{itemize}
      \item racing car
      \item private car
      \item lorry
    \end{itemize}
    \item bicycles
  \end{itemize}
  \end{ShowOutput}
\end{Example}
%
\EndIndex{Env}{itemize}%
\EndIndex{Cmd}{item}%
\EndIndex{Cmd}{labelitemi}%
\EndIndex{Cmd}{labelitemii}%
\EndIndex{Cmd}{labelitemiii}%
\EndIndex{Cmd}{labelitemiv}%


\begin{Declaration}
  \Environment{enumerate}\\
  \XMacro{item}\\
  \Macro{theenumi}\\
  \Macro{theenumii}\\
  \Macro{theenumiii}\\
  \Macro{theenumiv}\\
  \Macro{labelenumi}\\
  \Macro{labelenumii}\\
  \Macro{labelenumiii}\\
  \Macro{labelenumiv}
\end{Declaration}%
\BeginIndex{Env}{enumerate}%
\BeginIndex{Cmd}{item}%
\BeginIndex{Cmd}{theenumi}%
\BeginIndex{Cmd}{theenumii}%
\BeginIndex{Cmd}{theenumiii}%
\BeginIndex{Cmd}{theenumiv}%
\BeginIndex{Cmd}{labelenumi}%
\BeginIndex{Cmd}{labelenumii}%
\BeginIndex{Cmd}{labelenumiii}%
\BeginIndex{Cmd}{labelenumiv}%
Another form of a list often used is a numbered list which is already
implemented by the {\LaTeX} kernel. Depending on the level the
numbering\Index{numbering} uses the following characters: arabic
numbers, small letters, small roman numerals and capital letters. The
kind of numbering is defined with the macros \Macro{theenumi} down to
\Macro{theenumiv}. The output format is determined by the macros
\Macro{labelenumi} to \Macro{labelenumiv}. While the small letter of
the second level is followed by a round parenthesis, the values of all
other levels are followed by a dot. Every item is introduced with
\Macro{item}.
\begin{Example}
  Replacing every occurence of an \Environment{itemize} environment
  with an \Environment{enumerate} environment in the example above we
  get the following result:
  \begin{ShowOutput}[\baselineskip]
  \minisec{Vehicles}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item aeroplans
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item biplane
      \item jets
      \item transport planes
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item single-engined
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item{jet-driven}\label{xmp:maincls.jets}
          \item{propeller-driven}
        \end{enumerate}
        \item multi-engined
      \end{enumerate}
      \item helicopter
    \end{enumerate}
    \item automobiles
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item racing car
      \item private car
      \item lorry
    \end{enumerate}
    \item bicycles
  \end{enumerate}
  \end{ShowOutput}
  Using \Macro{label} within a list you can set labels which are
  referenced with \Macro{ref}. In the example above a label
  was set after the jet-driven, single-engined transport plane with
  \Macro{label}\PParameter{xmp:jets}. The \Macro{ref} value is then
  \ref{xmp:maincls.jets}.
\end{Example}

\EndIndex{Cmd}{labelenumi}%
\EndIndex{Cmd}{labelenumii}%

\begin{Declaration}
  \Environment{description}\\
  \XMacro{item}\OParameter{item}
\end{Declaration}%
\BeginIndex{Env}{description}%
\BeginIndex{Cmd}{item}%
Another list form is the description list. Its main use is the
description of several items. The item itself is an optional parameter
in \Macro{item}. The font\Index{font}\ChangedAt{v2.8p}{%
  \Class{scrbook}\and\Class{scrreprt}\and\Class{scrartcl}}%
, which is responsible for emphasizing the item can be changed with
the commands for the element
\FontElement{descriptionlabel}\IndexFontElement{descriptionlabel} (see
\autoref{tab:maincls.elementsWithoutText},
\autopageref{tab:maincls.elementsWithoutText}) described in
\autoref{sec:maincls.font}. Default setting is
\Macro{sffamily}\Macro{bfseries}.
\begin{Example}
  Instead of items in sans serif and bold you want them printed in the
  standard font in bold. Using
\begin{lstlisting}
  \setkomafont{descriptionlabel}{\normalfont\bfseries}
\end{lstlisting}
  you redefine the font accordingly.

  An example for a description list is the output of the page styles
  listed in \autoref{sec:maincls.pageStyle}. The heavily
  abbreviated source code is:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \begin{description}
    \item[empty] is the page style without
                 any header or footer
    \item[plain] is the page style without running headline.
    \item[headings] is the page style with running headline.
    \item[myheadings] is the page style for manual headline.
  \end{description}
\end{lstlisting}
  This abbreviated version gives:
  \begin{ShowOutput}
    \begin{description}
    \item[empty] is the page style without any header or footer
    \item[plain] is the page style without running headline.
    \item[headings] is the page style with running headline.
    \item[myheadings] is the page style for manual headline.
    \end{description}
  \end{ShowOutput}
\end{Example}
%
\EndIndex{Env}{description}%
\EndIndex{Cmd}{item}%


\begin{Declaration}
  \Environment{labeling}\OParameter{delimiter}\Parameter{widest pattern}\\
  \XMacro{item}\OParameter{key word}
\end{Declaration}%
\BeginIndex{Env}{labeling}%
\BeginIndex{Cmd}{item}%
An additional form of a description list in {\KOMAScript} is the
\Environment{labeling} environment. In difference to the
\Environment{description} environment you can provide a pattern, which
determines the indentation of all items. Furthermore you can put an
optional \PName{delimiter} between item and description.
\begin{Example}
  Slightly changing the example from the \Environment{description}
  environment we could write:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \begin{labeling}[~--]{%
      \usekomafont{descriptionlabel}myheadings}
    \item[\usekomafont{descriptionlabel}empty]
      Page style without header and footer
    \item[\usekomafont{descriptionlabel}plain]
      Page style for chapter beginnings without headline
    \item[\usekomafont{descriptionlabel}headings]
      Page style for running headline
    \item[\usekomafont{descriptionlabel}myheadings]
      Page style for manual headline
  \end{labeling}
\end{lstlisting}
  As result we get:
  \begin{ShowOutput}
    \begin{labeling}[~--]{\usekomafont{descriptionlabel}myheadings}
      \item[\usekomafont{descriptionlabel}empty]
      Page style without header and footer
    \item[\usekomafont{descriptionlabel}plain]
      Page style for chapter beginnings without headline
    \item[\usekomafont{descriptionlabel}headings]
      Page style for running headline
    \item[\usekomafont{descriptionlabel}myheadings]
      Page style for manual headline
    \end{labeling}
  \end{ShowOutput}
  As can be seen in this example a font changing command has to be
  repeated both in the pattern and in the optional parameter in every
  \Macro{item} command in this environment.
\end{Example}
Originally this environment was implemented for things like ``Given
is\dots, Asked is\dots, Solution'' that are often used in hand-outs.
By now this environment has found many different applications. For
example the environment for examples in this guide was defined with
the \Environment{labeling} environment.

\EndIndex{Env}{labeling}%
\EndIndex{Cmd}{item}%


\begin{Declaration}
  \Environment{verse}
\end{Declaration}%
\BeginIndex{Env}{verse}%
Normally the \Environment{verse} environment isn't perceived as a list
environment because you don't work with \Macro{item} commands. Instead
fixed line breaks are used like within the \Environment{flushleft}
environment. Yet internally in both the standard classes as well
as {\KOMAScript} it is a list environment.

In general the \Environment{verse} environment is used for
poems\Index{poems}.  Lines are indented both left and right. Single
verses are ended by a fixed line break \verb|\\|. Verses are set as a
paragraph, thus separated by an empty line. Often also
\Macro{medskip}\IndexCmd{medskip} or \Macro{bigskip}\IndexCmd{bigskip}
is used instead. To avoid a page break at the end of a line you insert
\verb|\\*| instead of \verb|\\|.
\begin{Example}
  As example the first lines of ``Little Red Riding Hood and the
  Wolf'' by Roald Dahl: 
\begin{lstlisting}
  \begin{verse}
    As soon as Wolf began to feel\\*
    that he would like a decent meal,\\*
    He went and knocked on Grandma's door.\\*
    When Grandma opened it, she saw\\*
    The sharp white teeth, the horrid grin,\\*
    And Wolfie said, 'May I come in?'
  \end{verse}
\end{lstlisting}
  The result would like as follows:
  \begin{ShowOutput}
  \begin{verse}
    As soon as Wolf began to feel\\*
    That he would like a decent meal,\\*
    He went and knocked on Grandma's door.\\*
    When Grandma opened it, she saw\\*
    The sharp white teeth, the horrid grin,\\*
    And Wolfie said, 'May I come in?'
  \end{verse}
  \end{ShowOutput}
  Yet if you have very long lines \verb|\\*| can not prevent a page
  break within a verse. That would be possible here for example:
  \begin{ShowOutput}
  \begin{verse}
    Both the philosoph and the house-owner\nopagebreak
    have always something to repair\\
    \bigskip
    Don't trust a men, my son, who tells you\nopagebreak
    that he has never lain.
  \end{verse}
  \end{ShowOutput}

  These two verses were separated by a \Macro{bigskip}.
\end{Example}
%
\EndIndex{Env}{verse}%


\begin{Declaration}
  \Environment{quote}\\
  \Environment{quotation}
\end{Declaration}%
\BeginIndex{Env}{quote}%
\BeginIndex{Env}{quotation}%
These two environments are also list environments and can be found
both in the standard and the {\KOMAScript} classes. Both environments
use justified text which is indented both on the left and right side.
Usually they are used to separate long citations\Index{citations} from
the main text. The difference between these two lies in the matter how
paragraphs are typeset. While \Environment{quote} paragraphs are
highlighted by vertical space, in \Environment{quotation} paragraphs
the first line is indented. This is also true for the first line of a
\Environment{quotation} environment. To get around this behaviour you
have to insert a \Macro{noindent} command\IndexCmd{noindent} in front.
\begin{Example}
  You want to highlight a short anecdote. You write the following
  \Environment{quotation} environment for this:
  %
\begin{lstlisting}
  A small example for a short anecdote:
  \begin{quotation}
    The old year was turning brown; the West Wind was
    calling;
        
    Tom caught the beechen leaf in the forest falling.
    ``I've caught the happy day blown me by the breezes!
    Why wait till morrow-year? I'll take it when me pleases.
    This I'll mend my boat and journey as it chances
    west down the withy-stream, following my fancies!''
    
    Little Bird sat on twig. ``Whillo, Tom! I heed you.
    I've a guess, I've a guess where your fancies lead you.
    Shall I go, shall I go, bring him word to meet you?''
  \end{quotation}
\end{lstlisting}
  The result is:
  \begin{ShowOutput}
    A small example for a short anecdote:
    \begin{quotation}
    The old year was turning brown; the West Wind was
    calling;
    
    Tom caught the beechen leaf in the forest falling.
    ``I've caught the happy day blown me by the breezes!
    Why wait till morrow-year? I'll take it when me pleases.
    This I'll mend my boat and journey as it chances
    west down the withy-stream, following my fancies!''
    
    Little Bird sat on twig. ``Whillo, Tom! I heed you.
    I've a guess, I've a guess where your fancies lead you.
    Shall I go, shall I go, bring him word to meet you?''
    \end{quotation}
  \end{ShowOutput}
  %
  Using a \Environment{quote} environment instead you get:
  %
  \begin{ShowOutput}
    A small example for a short anecdote:
     \begin{quote}\setlength{\parskip}{4pt plus 2pt minus 2pt}
    The old year was turning brown; the West Wind was

    Tom caught the beechen leaf in the forest falling.
    ``I've caught the happy day blown me by the breezes!

\begin{Declaration}
  \Environment{addmargin}\OParameter{left indentation}\Parameter{indentation}\\
  \Environment{addmargin*}\OParameter{inner indentation}\Parameter{indentation}
\end{Declaration}
\BeginIndex{Env}{addmargin}%
Similar to \Environment{quote} and \Environment{quotation} the
\Environment{addmargin} environment changes the margin\Index{margin}.
Different to the first two environments using \Environment{addmargin}
the user can influence the width of the indentation. Furthermore this
environment doesn't change the indentation of the first line and the
vertical spacing between paragraphs.

If only the obligatory argument \PName{indentation} is given, both the
left and right margin are expanded by this value. If the optional
argument \PName{indentation} is given the value \PName{left
  indentation} is added to \PName{indentation} at the left margin.

The starred \Environment{addmargin*} only differs from the normal
version in a twoside layout. In addition the difference only occurs if
the optional argument \PName{inner indentation} is used. In this case
this value is added to the normal inner indentation. Then the value of
\PName{indentation} determines the width of the opposite margin.

Both versions of this environment take also negative values for all
parameters. This has the effect of expanding the environment into the
margin.
\begin{Example}
  Suppose you write a documentation which includes short source code
  examples. To highlight these you want them separated from the text
  by a horizontal line and slightly spanning into the outer
  margin. First you define the environment:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \newenvironment{SourceCodeFrame}{%
    \begin{addmargin*}[1em]{-1em}%
      \begin{minipage}{\linewidth}%
        \rule{\linewidth}{2pt}%
  }{%
      \rule[.25\baselineskip]{\linewidth}{2pt}%
      \end{minipage}%
    \end{addmargin*}%
  }
\end{lstlisting}
  If you now put your source code in such an environment it will show
  up as:
  \begin{ShowOutput}
  \newenvironment{SourceCodeFrame}{%
    \begin{addmargin*}[1em]{-1em}%
      \begin{minipage}{\linewidth}%
        \rule{\linewidth}{2pt}%
  }{%
      \rule[.25\baselineskip]{\linewidth}{2pt}%
      \end{minipage}%
    \end{addmargin*}%
  }
  You define yourself the following environment:
  \begin{SourceCodeFrame}
\begin{lstlisting}
\newenvironment{\SourceCodeFrame}{%
  \begin{addmargin*}[1em]{-1em}%
    \begin{minipage}{\linewidth}%
      \rule{\linewidth}{2pt}%
}{%
    \rule[.25\baselineskip]{\linewidth}{2pt}%
    \end{minipage}%
  \end{addmargin*}%
}
\end{lstlisting}
  \end{SourceCodeFrame}
  This may be feasible or not. In any way it shows the usage of this
  environment.
  \end{ShowOutput}
  The optional argument of the \Environment{addmargin*} environment
  makes sure that the inner margin is extended by 1\Unit{em}. In turn
  the outer margin is decreased by 1\Unit{em}. The result is a shift
  by 1\Unit{em} to the outside.  Instead of \PValue{1em} you can use a
  length of, for example, \PValue{2\Macro{parindent}} of course.
\end{Example}
There is one problem with the \Environment{addmargin*} which you
should be aware of. If a page break occurs within an
\Environment{addmargin*} environment the indentation on the following
page is on the wrong side.  This means that suddenly the \PName{inner
  indentation} is applied on the outside of the page. Therefore it is
recommended to prevent page breaks within this environment. This can
be achieved by using an additional \Macro{parbox} or, as in the
example above, a \Environment{minipage}. This makes use of the fact
that neither the argument of a \Macro{parbox} nor the content of a
\Environment{minipage} is broken at the end of a page.  Unfortunately
this is not without disadvantages: In some cases pages can't be filled
correctly which has the effect of several warnings.

By the way, whether a page is going to be on the left or right side of the
book can't be determined in the first \LaTeX\ compiling for sure.  For details
please refer to the explanation for the command \Macro{ifthispageodd} and
\Macro{ifthispagewasodd} at \autoref{sec:maincls.pageStyle},
\autopageref{desc:maincls.macro.ifthispageodd}.
%
\EndIndex{Env}{addmargin}%


\begin{Explain}
  One concluding note to the list environments: In the internet and
  support it is often asked why such an environment is followed by a
  indented\Index{indentation} paragraph. In fact this is the result of
  demanding a new paragraph. In \LaTeX\ empty lines are interpreted as
  a new paragraph. This is also the case before and after list
  environments. Thus, if you want a list environment to be set within
  a paragraph you have to omit empty lines before and after. To
  separate this environment from the rest of your text nevertheless,
  you can insert a comment line which only consists of a percent
  character in the {\LaTeX} source.

\subsection{Margin Notes}
\label{sec:maincls.marginNotes}

  \Macro{marginpar}\OParameter{margin note left}\Parameter{margin note}\\
  \Macro{marginline}\Parameter{margin note}
\end{Declaration}%
\BeginIndex{Cmd}{marginpar}%
\BeginIndex{Cmd}{marginline}%
Usually margin notes\Index[indexmain]{margin notes} in {\LaTeX} are
inserted with the command \Macro{marginpar}. They are placed in the
outer margin.  In documents with oneside layout the right border is
used. Though \Macro{marginpar} optionally can take a different margin
note in case the output is on the left margin, margin notes are always
in justified layout.  But many users prefer left- or right-aligned
margin notes instead.  {\KOMAScript} offers the command
\Macro{marginline} for that.
\begin{Example}
  At several places in this documentation you find the classes mentioned
  written in the margin. This can be produced\footnote{In fact, instead
  of \Macro{texttt}, a semantic highlighting was used. To avoid confusion
  this was replaced in the example.} with:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \marginline{\texttt{scrartcl}}
\end{lstlisting}

  Instead of \Macro{marginline} you could have used \Macro{marginpar}
  too. In fact the first command is implemented internally as:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \marginpar[\raggedleft\texttt{scrartcl}]
    {\raggedright\texttt{scrartcl}}
\end{lstlisting}
  Eventually \Macro{marginline} is only an abbreviating writing of the
  code above.
\end{Example}
%
\begin{Explain}
  Unfortunately \Macro{marginpar} doesn't always work correctly in the
  twoside\Index{twoside} layout. Whether a margin note is going to show
  up on the left or right is already decided while evaluating the command
  \Macro{marginpar}. If the output routine now shifts the margin note
  onto the next page the alignment isn't correct anymore. This behaviour
  is deeply founded within {\LaTeX} and was therefore declared a feature
  by the \LaTeX3 team. \Macro{marginline} suffers from this ``feature''
  too. The package \Package{mparhack}\IndexPackage{mparhack} (see
  \cite{package:mparhack}) would be a solution for this problem with both
  \Macro{marginpar} and \Macro{marginline}.

  Note that you may not use \Macro{marginpar} or \Macro{marginnote} within
  float environemnts like tables or figures. And you may not use these
  commands at displayed math.

\subsection{Tables and Figures}
\label{sec:maincls.floats}

\begin{Explain}
  With the floating environments {\LaTeX} offers a very capable and
  comfortable mechanism for automatic placement of
  figures\Index{figures} and tables\Index{tables}. But often these
  floating environments\Index[indexmain] {floating environments} are
  slightly misunderstood by beginners. They often ask for a fixed
  position of a table or figure within the text. As these floating
  environments are being referenced in the text this is not necessary
  in most cases. It is not sensible too because such an object can
  only be set on the page if there is enough space left. If this is
  not the case the object would have to be shifted onto the next page
  leaving a huge space on the page before.
  
  % TODO: Translate this:
%  Haeufig werden die Fliessumgebungen\Index[indexmain]%
%  {Fliessumgebung=Fliessumgebung} von Anfaengern nicht richtig
%  verstanden. So wird oft die Forderung aufgestellt, eine Tabelle oder
%  Abbildung genau an einer bestimmten Position im Text zu setzen. Dies
%  ist jedoch nicht erforderlich, da auf Fliessumgebungen im Text ueber
%  eine Referenz verwiesen wird. Es ist auch nicht sinnvoll, da ein
%  solches Objekt an einer Stelle nur dann gesetzt werden kann, wenn
%  auf der Seite noch genuegend Platz fuer das Objekt vorhanden ist. Ist
%  dies nicht der Fall, muesste das Objekt auf die naechste Seite
%  umbrochen werden und auf der aktuellen Seite wuerde ein
%  moeglicherweise sehr grosser leerer Raum bleiben.

  Often in many documents the same optional argument for positioning
  an object is found with every floating object. This also makes no
  sense. In such cases you should change the standard parameters
  globally. For more details refer to \cite{DANTE:FAQ}.\par
\end{Explain}

One last important note before starting this section: The most
mechanisms described here which extend the capabilities of the
standard classes do not work correctly when used together with
packages which interfere with the typesetting of captions of figures

In the standard classes captions of tables and figures are inserted
with the \Macro{caption} command below the table or figure. In general
this is correct with figures. Opinions differ as to whether captions
of tables are to be placed above or together with captions of
figures\Index{captions of figures} below the table\Index{captions of
  tables}. That's the reason why \KOMAScript{}, unlike the standard
classes, offers \Macro{captionbelow} for captions below and
\Macro{captionabove} for captions above tables or figures. Using
\Macro{caption} together with figures always produces captions below
the figure whereas the behaviour of \Macro{captionbelow} can be
modified using the options
\Option{tablecaptionabove}\IndexOption{tablecaptionabove} and
\Option{tablecaptionbelow}\IndexOption{tablecaptionbelow} (see
\autoref{sec:maincls.formattingOptions},
\autopageref{desc:maincls.option.tablecaptionabove}). For compatibility
reasons the default behaviour of \Macro{caption} together with tables
is similar to \Macro{captionbelow}.
%
\begin{Example}
  Instead of using captions below the table you want to place your
  captions above it\Index{table caption}, because you have tables
  which span over more then one page. In the standard classes you
  could only write:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \begin{table}
    \caption{This is an example table}
    \begin{tabular}{llll}
      This & is & an & example.\\\hline
      This & is & an & example.\\
      This & is & an & example.
    \end{tabular}
  \end{table}
\end{lstlisting}
  Then you would get the unsatisfying result:
  \begin{ShowOutput}\centering
    {\usekomafont{caption}{\usekomafont{captionlabel}\tablename~30.2:}
      This is an example table.}\\
        \begin{tabular}{llll}
      This & is & an & example.\\\hline
      This & is & an & example.\\
      This & is & an & example.
        \end{tabular}
\end{ShowOutput}
  Using \KOMAScript{} you write instead:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \begin{table}
    \captionabove{This is just an example table}
    \begin{tabular}{llll}
      This & is & an & example.\\\hline
      This & is & an & example.\\
      This & is & an & example.
    \end{tabular}
  \end{table}
\end{lstlisting}
  Then you get:
  \begin{ShowOutput}\centering
    {\usekomafont{caption}{\usekomafont{captionlabel}\tablename~30.2:}
      This is just an example table}\\\vskip\abovecaptionskip
    \begin{tabular}{llll}
      This & is & an & example.\\\hline
      This & is & an & example.\\
      This & is & an & example.
    \end{tabular}
  \end{ShowOutput}
  Since you want all your tables typeset with captions above you could
  of course use the option \Option{tablecaptionabove} instead (see
  \autoref{sec:maincls.formattingOptions},
  \autopageref{desc:maincls.option.tablecaptionabove}). Then you can use
  \Macro{caption} as you would in the standard classes. You will get
  the same result as with \Macro{captionabove}.
\end{Example}

\begin{Explain}
  Some would argue that you could achieve the same result using the
  \Macro{topcaption} from the \Package{topcapt}
  package\IndexPackage{topcapt} (see \cite{package:topcapt}). But that
  is  not the case. The command \Macro{topcaption} is neglected by
  packages which directly redefine the \Macro{caption} macro. The
  \Package{hyperref} package (see \cite{package:hyperref}) is one example
  for this. In \KOMAScript{} \Macro{captionabove} and
  \Macro{captionbelow} are implemented so, that the changes have an
  effect on both of these commands.
  
  If the \Package{longtable} package\IndexPackage{longtable} is used
  \KOMAScript{} makes sure that captions above tables which are placed within
  a \Environment{longtable} environment have the same appearance as in a
  normal \Environment{table} environment. This also means that you can apply
  the same settings as in a \Environment{table} environment. Please note that
  in the \Package{longtable} package the maximum width of a table caption can
  be limited and the default is set to 4\Unit{in} (see
  \cite{package:longtable}). Using \KOMAScript{} this mechanism in
  \Package{longtable} only works when the class option \Option{origlongtable}
  is set (see \autoref{sec:maincls.formattingOptions},
  \autopageref{desc:maincls.option.origlongtable}). If
  \Package{caption2}\IndexPackage{caption2} (see \cite{package:caption}) is
  loaded, table captions are handled by this package.
  
  Please note that \Macro{captionabove} and \Macro{captionbelow} if placed
  within a \Environment{float} environment which was defined using the
  \Package{float}\IndexPackage{float} package have the same behaviour as
  described in \cite{package:float} for the \Macro{caption} command.  In this
  case, only the float style determines whether it is a caption below or above
  the figure or table.

Apart\ChangedAt{v2.8q}{%
  \Class{scrbook}\and\Class{scrreprt}\and\Class{scrartcl}} from
captions above and below the figure you often find captions, in
particular with small figures, which are placed beside the figure. In
general in this case both the baseline of the figure and the caption
are aligned at the bottom. With some fiddling and the use of two
\Macro{parbox} commands this could be achieved in the standard
classes.  But \KOMAScript{} offers a special environment for this
problem. This environment can be used within the floating environment.
The first optional parameter \PName{entry} and the obligatory
parameter \PName{title} are similar to the parameters of
\Macro{caption}, \Macro{captionabove} or \Macro{captionbelow}. The
\PName{title} is placed beside the content of the environment in this
case.

Whether the \PName{title} is placed left or right can be determined by
the parameter \PName{placement}. One of the following letters is
accepted:
\begin{labeling}[--~]{\PValue[o]}
\item[\PValue{l}] left
\item[\PValue{r}] right
\item[\PValue{i}] inner margin in twoside layout
\item[\PValue{o}] outer margin in twoside layout
\end{labeling}
Default setting is at the right side of the content of the
environment.  If either \PValue{o} or \PValue{i} are used you have to
run {\LaTeX} twice to get the correct placement.

As default the content of the environment and the \PName{title} fill
the whole available text width. However, using the optional parameter
\PName{width} it is possible to adjust the used width. This width
could even be more than the current text width.

When supplying a \PName{width} the used width is centered with respect
to the text width. Using the optional parameter \PName{offset} you can
shift the environment relative to the left margin. A positive value
corresponds to a shift to the right whereas a negative value
corresponds to a shift to the left. An \PName{offset} of 0\Unit{pt}
gives you a left-aligned output.

Adding a star to the optional parameter \PName{offset} the value means
a shift relative to the right margin on left pages in double sided
layout. A positive value corresponds to a shift towards the outer
margin whereas a negative value corresponds to a shift towards the
inner margin. An \PName{offset} of 0\Unit{pt} means alignment with the
inner margin. As mentioned before, in some cases it takes two \LaTeX{}
runs for this to work correctly.

\begin{Example}
  An example for the usage of the \Environment{captionbeside} environment
  can be found in \autoref{fig:maincls.captionbeside}.
  This figure was typeset with:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \begin{figure}
    \begin{captionbeside}[Example for a figure description]%
      {A figure description which is neither above nor
       below, but beside the figure}[i][\linewidth][2em]*
      \fbox{%
        \parbox[b][5\baselineskip][c]{.25\textwidth}{%
          \hspace*{\fill}\KOMAScript\hspace*{\fill}\par}}
    \end{captionbeside}
    \label{fig:maincls.captionbeside}
  \end{figure}
\end{lstlisting}
  \begin{figure}
    \begin{captionbeside}[Example for a figure description]%
      {A figure description which is neither above nor 
       below, but beside the figure}[i][\linewidth][2em]*
      \fbox{%
        \parbox[b][5\baselineskip][c]{.25\textwidth}{%
          \hspace*{\fill}\KOMAScript\hspace*{\fill}\par}}
    \end{captionbeside}
    \label{fig:maincls.captionbeside}
  \end{figure}
  Thus, the width is the current available width
  \PValue{\Macro{linewidth}}. However, this width is shifted
  \PValue{2em} to the outside. The title or the description is placed
  inside beside the figure. Therefore, the figure itself is shifted
  2\Unit{em} into the margin.

Using\OnlyAt{\Package{float}} the \Package{float}\IndexPackage{float} package

Therefore \KOMAScript{} defines the two additional styles \PValue{komaabove}

In {\KOMAScript} there are different ways to change the formatting of
the description. The definition of different font styles was already
explained above. This or the caption delimiter between the label and
the label text itself is specified in the macro \Macro{captionformat}.
In difference to all other \Macro{\dots}format commands in this case
it doesn't contain the counter but the items which follow it. The
original definition is:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \newcommand*{\captionformat}{:\ }
\end{lstlisting}
This too can be changed with \Macro{renewcommand}.
\begin{Example}
  For some inexplicable reasons you want a dash with spaces before and
  after instead of a colon followed by a space as label delimiter. You
  define:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \renewcommand*{\captionformat}{~--~}
\end{lstlisting}
  This definition you should put in the preamble of your document.

It was already mentioned that \Macro{captionformat} doesn't contain a
formatting for the label itself. But this label shouldn't in any case
be changed using redefinitions of the commands for the output of
counters, \Macro{thefigure} or \Macro{thetable}. Such a redefinition
would have unwanted side effects on the output of \Macro{ref} or, for
example, of the list of figures. For this case {\KOMAScript} offers
two \Macro{\dots format} commands instead. These are predefined as
follows:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \newcommand*{\figureformat}{\figurename~\thefigure\autodot}
  \newcommand*{\tableformat}{\tablename~\thetable\autodot}
\end{lstlisting}
They also can be adapted to your personal preferences with
\Macro{renewcommand}.
\begin{Example}
  From time to time label texts without any label and delimiter are
  wanted. In {\KOMAScript} it takes only the following definitions to

As mentioned previously, in the standard classes the captions are set
in a not-hanging style. That means that in descriptions with more than
one line the second and subsequent lines start directly beneath the
label.  There is no straight way in the standard classes to change
this behaviour. In {\KOMAScript}, on the contrary, beginning at the
second line all lines are indented by the width of the label.

This behaviour which corresponds to the usage of \Macro{setcaphanging}
can easily be changed by using the command \Macro{setcapindent} or
\Macro{setcapindent*}. Here the parameter \PName{Einzug} determines
the indentation of the second and subsequent lines.

If you want a line break before the label and the description you
define the indentation \PName{xindent} of the description with the
starred version of the command instead: \Macro{setcapindent*}.

Using a negative value of \PName{indent} instead, a page break is
inserted and only the first line but not the subsequent lines are
indented by \(-\PName{indent}\).

Whether one-line captions are set as captions with more than one line
or are treated separately is specified with the class options
\Option{onelinecaption} and \Option{noonelinecaption}. For details
please refer to the explanations of this options in
\autoref{sec:maincls.layoutOptions},
\autopageref{desc:maincls.option.noonelinecaption}.

\begin{Example}
  As examples please refer to the
  figures~\ref{fig:maincls.caption.first} to
  \ref{fig:maincls.caption.last}. As you can see the usage of a
  complete hanging indentation is not preferable together with a small
  column width:
\begin{lstlisting}

    \setcapindent{1em}

    \caption{Examples with slightly indented caption

  \end{figure}
\end{lstlisting}
  As can be seen the formatting can also be changed locally within the
  \Environment{figure} environment\IndexEnv{figure}.

Using\ChangedAt{v2.8q}{%
  \Class{scrbook}\and\Class{scrreprt}\and\Class{scrartcl}} these three
commands you can specify the width and justification of the label
text.  In general the whole text or column width is available for the
description.

With the command \Macro{setcapwidth} you can decrease this
\PName{width}.  The obligatory argument determines the \PName{with} of
the description.  As an optional argument you can supply one letter
which specifies the horizontal justification. The possible
justifications are given in the following list.
\begin{labeling}[--~]{\PValue[o]}
\item[\PValue{l}] left-aligned
\item[\PValue{c}] centered
\item[\PValue{r}] right-aligned
\item[\PValue{i}] alignment at the inner margin in a double sided output
\item[\PValue{o}] alignment at the outer margin in a double sided output
\end{labeling}
The justification inside and outside corresponds to left-aligned and
right-aligned respectively in single sided output. Within
\Package{longtable}\IndexPackage{longtable} tables the justification
inside or outside doesn't work correctly. In particular the captions
of tables of subsequent pages are aligned corresponding to the first
part of the table. This is a problem which has its roots in the
implementation of \Package{longtable}.

With the command \Macro{setcapmargin} you can specify a \PName{margin}
which is to be left free next to the description in addition to the
normal text margin. If you want margins with different widths at the
left and right side you can specify these using the optional argument
\PName{margin left}. The starred version \Macro{setcapmargin*} defines
instead of a \PName{margin left} a \PName{margin inside} in a double
sided layout. In case of \Package{longtable}\IndexPackage{longtable}
tables you have to deal with the same problem with justification
inside or outside as mentioned with the macro \Macro{setcapwidth}.
Furthermore the usage of \Macro{setcapmargin} or \Macro{setcapmargin*}
switches the option \Option{noonelinecaption} (see
\autoref{sec:maincls.layoutOptions},
\autopageref{desc:maincls.option.noonelinecaption}) for the descriptions which
are typeset with this margin setting.

\begin{Explain}
  \Package{longtable} places the description in a box, which is issued
  again at the subsequent pages if needed. While treating a box the
  macros needed for the creation of it aren't run through
  again. That's why it is not possible for \KOMAScript{} to swop
  margin settings in double sided layout on even pages. This would be
  necessary to produce a justification which is shifted towards the
  outside or inside.
  
  You can also submit negative values for \PName{margin} and
  \PName{margin right} or \PName{margin outside}. This has the effect
  of the description spanning into the margin.
\end{Explain}

\begin{Example}
  A rather odd problem is a figure caption which is both centered and
  of the same width as the figure itself. If the width of the figure
  is known the solution with \KOMAScript{} is quite easy. Suppose the
  figure has a width of 8\Unit{cm}, it only takes:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \setcapwidth[c]{8cm}
\end{lstlisting}
  directly in front of \Macro{caption} or \Macro{captionbelow}. If it
  is unknown first you have to define a length in the preamble of your
  document:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \newlength{\Figurewidth}
\end{lstlisting}
  Having done this you can calculate the width directly with the
  \LaTeX{} command \Macro{settowidth} (see \cite{latex:usrguide})
 in many cases. A possible solution would look as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \begin{figure}
    \centering%
    \settowidth{\Figurewidth}{%
      \fbox{\quad\KOMAScript\qaud}%
      }%
    \fbox{\quad\KOMAScript\quad}%
    \setcapwidth[c]{\Figurewidth}
    \caption{Example of a centered caption below the figure}
  \end{figure}
\end{lstlisting}
  However, it is awkward to write the content twice and to use
  \Macro{setcapwidth} with every figure. But nothing is easier than
  defining a new command in the preamble of your document which
  hides the three steps:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Defining the width of the argument
  \item Specifying the width of the caption
  \item Output of the argument
  \end{enumerate}
  in:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \newcommand{\Figure}[1]{%
    \settowidth{\Figurewidth}{#1}%
    \setcapwidth[c]{\Figurewidth}%
    #1}
\end{lstlisting}
  Using this command the example abbreviates to:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \begin{figure}
    \centering%
    \Figure{\fbox{\quad\KOMAScript\quad}}%
    \caption{Example of a centered caption below the figure}
  \end{figure}
\end{lstlisting}
  
  But a command has the disadvantage that errors in the macros of the
  argument in case of arguments with more than one line aren't
  reported with the very correct line number by \LaTeX{}. In these
  cases the usage of an environment has advantages. But then the
  question is raised how the width of the content of the environment
  can be determined. The solution offers the \Environment{lrbox}
  environment, which is described in \cite{latex:usrguide}:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \newsavebox{\Figurebox}
  \newenvironment{FigureDefinesCaptionWidth}{%
    \begin{lrbox}{\Figurebox}%
  }{%
    \end{lrbox}%
    \global\setbox\Figurebox=\box\Figurebox%
    \aftergroup\Setfigurebox%
  }
  \newcommand{\Setfigurebox}{%
    \Figure{\usebox{\Figurebox}}}
\end{lstlisting}
  This definition uses the macro \Macro{Figure} defined above.  In
  the main text you write:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \begin{figure}
    \centering%
    \begin{FigureDefinesCaptionWidth}
      \fbox{\hspace{1em}\KOMAScript\hspace{1em}}
    \end{FigureDefinesCaptionWidth}
    \caption{Example of a centered caption below the figure}
  \end{figure}
\end{lstlisting}
  Admittingly, the environment in this example is not necessary. But
  its definition using \Macro{global} is quite clever. Most users
  wouldn't be able to define such an environment without help. But as
  this can be very useful, it was introduced in the example above.
  
  If the \Environment{captionbeside} environment wouldn't exist you
  could nevertheless place the figure caption beside the figure in a
  quite simple way. For this \Macro{Setfigurebox} from the example
  above would have to be redefined first:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \renewcommand{\Setfigurebox}{%
    \settowidth{\captionwidth}{\usebox{\Figurebox}}%
    \parbox[b]{\captionwidth}{\usebox{\Figurebox}}%
    \hfill%
    \addtolength{\captionwidth}{1em}%
    \addtolength{\captionwidth}{-\hsize}%
    \setlength{\captionwidth}{-\captionwidth}%
    \setcapwidth[c]{\captionwidth}%
    }
\end{lstlisting}
  As the next step you only have to put the \Macro{caption} command in
  a \Macro{parbox} too:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \begin{figure}
    \centering%
    \begin{FigureSetsCaptionWidth}
      \fbox{\rule{0pt}{5\baselineskip}%
        \hspace{1em}\KOMAScript\hspace{1em}}
    \end{FigureSetsCaptionWidth}
    \parbox[b]{\Figurewidth}{%
      \caption{Example of a centered caption
               below the figure}
    }
  \end{figure}
\end{lstlisting}
  The \Macro{rule} command in this example only serves as an unvisible
  support to produce an example figure with a greater vertical height.
\end{Example}
%
\EndIndex{Cmd}{setcapwidth}%
\EndIndex{Cmd}{setcapmargin}%
\EndIndex{Cmd}{setcapmargin*}%


\subsection{Logical Markup of Text}
\label{sec:maincls.emphasis}

\begin{Explain}
  \LaTeX{} offers different possibilities for logical
  markup\Index{logical markup}\Index{markup} of text. In a sense, a 
  heading is a kind of markup too. However, in this section we are
  only concerned with direct markup, i.e. markup which doesn't have an
  additional meaning and which can be used for different
  purposes. More details to the normally defined possibilities you can
  find in \cite{lshort}, \cite{latex:usrguide} and
  \cite{latex:fntguide}.
\end{Explain}

\begin{Declaration}
  \Macro{textsubscript}\Parameter{text}
\end{Declaration}
\BeginIndex{Cmd}{textsubscript}%
In \autoref{sec:maincls.footnotes},
\autopageref{desc:maincls.macro.textsuperscript} the command
\Macro{textsuperscript}\IndexCmd{textsuperscript} was already
introduced which is a part of the \LaTeX{} kernel. Unfortunately
\LaTeX{} itself doesn't offer a command to produce a text in
subscript\Index{text, subscript}\Index{subscript} instead of
superscript\Index{text, superscript}\Index{superscript}. \KOMAScript{}
defines \Macro{textsubscript} for this.
%
\begin{Example}
  You are writing a text on the human metabolism. From time to time
  you have to mention some simple sum formulas in which the
  numbers are in subscript. Being convinced from logical markup you
  first define in the document preamble or in a separate package:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \newcommand*{\Molek}[2]{#1\textsubscript{#2}}
\end{lstlisting}
  \newcommand*{\Molek}[2]{#1\textsubscript{#2}}
  Using this you then write:
\begin{lstlisting}
  The cell produces its energy from reaction of
  \Molek C6\Molek H{12}\Molek O6 and \Molek O2 to
  \Molek H2\Molek O{} and \Molek C{}\Molek O2.
  However, Arsenic (\Molek{As}{}) has a detrimental
  effect on the metabolism.
\end{lstlisting}
  The output looks as follows:
  \begin{ShowOutput}
  The cell produces its energy from reaction of \Molek C6\Molek
  H{12}\Molek O6 and \Molek O2 to \Molek H2\Molek O{} and \Molek
  C{}\Molek O2.  However, Arsenic (\Molek{As}{}) has a detrimental
  effect on the metabolism.
  \end{ShowOutput}
  Some time later you decide that the sum formulas should be
  typeset in sans serif. Now you can see the advantages of a
  consequent logical markup. You only have the redefine the
  \Macro{Molek} command:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \newcommand*{\Molek}[2]{\textsf{#1\textsubscript{#2}}}
\end{lstlisting}
  \renewcommand*{\Molek}[2]{\textsf{#1\textsubscript{#2}}}
  Now the output in the whole document changes to:
  \begin{ShowOutput}
  The cell produces its energy from reaction of \Molek C6\Molek
  H{12}\Molek O6 and \Molek O2 to \Molek H2\Molek O{} and \Molek
  C{}\Molek O2.  However, Arsenic (\Molek{As}{}) has a detrimental
  effect on the metabolism.
  \end{ShowOutput}
\end{Example}
\begin{Explain}
  In the example above the writing ``\verb|\Molek C6|'' is used. This
  makes use of the fact that arguments which consist of only one
  character doesn't have to be enclosed in parenthesis. That's why
  ``\verb|\Molek C6|'' is similar to ``\verb|\Molek{C}{6}|''. You
  might already know this from indices or powers in mathematical
  environments, such as ``\verb|$x^2$|'' instead of ``\verb|$x^{2}$|''
  for ``$x^2$''.

\section{Appendix}
\label{sec:maincls.appendix}

The last part of a document usually contains the
appendix\Index{appendix}, the bibliography\Index{bibliography} and, if
necessary, the index\Index{index}.

\begin{Declaration}
  \Macro{appendix}
\end{Declaration}%
\BeginIndex{Cmd}{appendix}%
The appendix in the standard as well as the {\KOMAScript} classes is
introduced with \Macro{appendix}. This command switches, among other
things, the chapter numbering to upper case letters thus making sure
that the rules according to \cite{DUDEN} are being followed. These
rules are explained in more detail in the description of the class
options \Option{pointednumbers} and \Option{pointlessnumbers} in
\autoref{sec:maincls.formattingOptions},
\autopageref{desc:maincls.option.pointlessnumbers}.

Please note that \Macro{appendix} is a command, \emph{not} an
environment!  This command does not need an argument. The sectioning
commands in the appendix are used in the same way as in the main part.

%
\EndIndex{Cmd}{appendix}


\begin{Declaration}
  \Macro{appendixmore}
\end{Declaration}%
\BeginIndex{Cmd}{appendixmore}%
There is a peculiarity within the \Macro{appendix} command in the
{\KOMAScript} classes. In case the command \Macro{appendixmore} is
defined, \Macro{appendix} is executed too. Internally the
{\KOMAScript} classes \Class{scrbook} and \Class{scrreprt} take
advantage of this behaviour for implementing the options
\Option{appendixprefix} and \Option{noappendixprefix} (see
\autoref{sec:maincls.layoutOptions},
\autopageref{desc:maincls.option.appendixprefix}). You should take care of this
in case you are going to define or redefine the \Macro{appendixmore}
by yourself. In case one of these options is set, you will receive an
error message when using
\verb|\newcommand{\appendixmore}{|\dots\verb|}|. This is thought to
prevent you from changing options without noticing.

\begin{Example}
  You do not want the chapters in the main part of the classes
  \Class{scrbook} or \Class{scrreprt} to be introduced by a prefix line
  (see layout options \Option{chapterprefix} and \Option{nochapterprefix}
  in \autoref{sec:maincls.layoutOptions},
  \autopageref{desc:maincls.option.chapterprefix}). For being consistent you
  do not want such a line in the appendix either. Instead you would like
  to see the word "`Chapter"' in the language of your choice written in
  front of the chapter letter and, simultaneously, in the page headings.
  Instead of using the layout options \Option{appendixprefix} or
  \Option{noappendixprefix}, you would define in the document preamble:
%
\begin{lstlisting}
  \newcommand*{\appendixmore}{%
    \renewcommand*{\chapterformat}{%
      \appendixname~\thechapter\autodot\enskip}
    \renewcommand*{\chaptermarkformat}{%
      \appendixname~\thechapter\autodot\enskip}
  }
\end{lstlisting}
%  
  In case you are going to change your mind and want to use the option
  \Option{appendixprefix} at a later state, you will get an error
  message because of the already defined \Macro{appendixmore} command.
  This prevents the definition mentioned above from changing the
  settings already set using \Option{chapterprefix} and
  \Option{nochapterprefix}.
  
  It is also possible to get a similar behaviour of the appendix for
  the class \Class{scrartcl}. You would write in the preamble of your
  document:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \newcommand*{\appendixmore}{%
    \renewcommand*{\othersectionlevelsformat}[1]{%
      \ifthenelse{\equal{##1}{section}}{\appendixname~}{}%
      \csname the##1\endcsname\autodot\enskip}
    \renewcommand*{\sectionmarkformat}{%
      \appendixname~\thesection\autodot\enskip}
  }
\end{lstlisting}
  In addition the package \Package{ifthen}\IndexPackage{ifthen} (see
  \cite{package:ifthen}) is required.
  
  Redefined commands are explained in more detail in
  \autoref{sec:maincls.structure}, \autopageref{desc:maincls.macro.partformat}
  and \autopageref{desc:maincls.macro.chaptermark}.
\end{Example}
%
\EndIndex{Cmd}{appendixmore}%


\begin{Declaration}
  \Macro{setbibpreamble}\Parameter{preamble}
\end{Declaration}%
\BeginIndex{Cmd}{setbibpreamble}%
The command \Macro{setbibpreamble} can be used for setting a preamble
for the bibliography\Index{bibliography}. This can be achieved by
placing the preamble before the command for issuing the bibliography.
However, it doesn't have to be directly in front of it. For example it
could be placed at the beginning of the document. Similar to the class
options \Option{bibtotoc} and \Option{bibtotocnumbered} this command
can only be successful if you haven't loaded a package which prevents
this by redefining the \Environment{thebibliography} environment.
Though the \Package{natbib} package \IndexPackage{natbib} unauthorized
uses internal macros of {\KOMAScript} it could be made sure that
\Macro{setbibpreamble} works with the current version of
\Package{natbib} (see \cite{package:natbib}).

\begin{Example}
  You want to point out that the sorting of the references in the
  bibliography is not according to their occuring in the text but in
  alphabetical order. You use the following command:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \setbibpreamble{References are in alphabetical order.
    References with more than one author are sorted
    according to the first author.}
\end{lstlisting}
  The \Macro{bigskip}\IndexCmd{bigskip} command makes sure that the
  preamble and the first reference are separated by a big skip.
  
  Another usage of the preamble in the bibliography would be setting
  the references ragged right. Just put the preamble as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \setbibpreamble{\raggedright}
\end{lstlisting}
  You can have a look at the result in the bibliography of this guide.
\end{Example}
%
\EndIndex{Cmd}{setbibpreamble}


\begin{Declaration}
  \Macro{setindexpreamble}\Parameter{preamble}
\end{Declaration}%
\BeginIndex{Cmd}{setindexpreamble}%
Similar to the bibliography you can use a preamble in the index. This
is often the case if you have more than one index or if you use
different kinds of referencing by highlighting the page numbers in
different ways.

\begin{Example}
  You have a document in which terms are both defined an used. The
  page numbers of definitions are in bold. Of course you want to make
  your reader aware of this fact. Thus you insert a preamble in the
  index:
\begin{lstlisting}
  \setindexpreamble{In \textbf{bold} printed page numbers
    are references to the definition of terms.\par\bigskip}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{Example}
%
Please note that the page style of the first page of the index is
changed. The applied page style is defined in the macro
\Macro{indexpagestyle}(see \autoref{sec:maincls.pageStyle},
\autopageref{desc:maincls.macro.titlepagestyle}).

The production, sorting and output of the index is done by the
standard \LaTeX{} packages and additional programs. Similar to the
standard classes {\KOMAScript} only provides the basic macros and
environments.

\section{Obsolete Commands}
\label{sec:maincls.obsolete}

\begin{Explain}
  In this section you will find commands, which should not be used any
  more. They are part of older \KOMAScript{} versions. For compatibility
  reasons they can still be used in the new \KOMAScript{} release. There
  are new mechanisms and user interfaces however, which you should use
  instead. The reason for listing the obsolete macros in this
  documentation is to aid users with understanding old documents.
  Furthermore, package authors are free to use these macros in the future.

  \begin{Declaration}
    \Macro{sectfont}
  \end{Declaration}
  \BeginIndex{Cmd}{sectfont}%
  This macro sets the font which is used for all section headings, the
  main title an the highest level below \Macro{part} in the table of
  contents. Use element \FontElement{sectioning} instead, which is
  described in more detail in \autoref{sec:maincls.font}.%
  \EndIndex{Cmd}{sectfont}%

  \begin{Declaration}
    \Macro{capfont} \\
    \Macro{caplabelfont}
  \end{Declaration}
  \BeginIndex{Cmd}{capfont}%
  \BeginIndex{Cmd}{caplabelfont}%
  The macro \Macro{capfont} sets the font which is used for captions
  in tables and figures. The macro \Macro{caplabelfont} sets the font
  which is used for the label and numbering of tables and pictures.
  Please use element \FontElement{caption} and
  \FontElement{captionlabel} of the current \KOMAScript{} instead
  which are described in \autoref{sec:maincls.font}.%
  \EndIndex{Cmd}{capfont}%
  \EndIndex{Cmd}{caplabelfont}%

  \begin{Declaration}
    \Macro{descfont}
  \end{Declaration}
  \BeginIndex{Cmd}{descfont}%
  This macro sets the font for the optional item arguments of an
  \Environment{description} environment. Please use element
  \FontElement{descriptionlabel} instead, which are described in
  section ~\ref{sec:maincls.font}.%
  \EndIndex{Cmd}{descfont}%
